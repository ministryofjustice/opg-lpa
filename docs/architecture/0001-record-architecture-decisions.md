# 0001. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2021-09-02

## Status

* Proposed (2021-09-02)

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as
[described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

We will not burden the project with additional dependencies for creating
ADRs: the format is simple enough to copy an existing ADR and
change appropriate fields manually.

The name of the file will contain the number of the ADR, which
will be exactly copied into the title inside the ADR itself. For
example, this file is 0001-record-architecture-decisions.md,
so the number "0001" (rather than "1") is in the title. (In other
teams, the number "1" is used, but we will use the full number.)

The Date given in the decision is the date it was created.

Each status will be recorded on the decision, along with the date it came into force.
This is to enable tracking of when decisions were proposed/accepted/superseded etc.,
which should help identify stale decisions (e.g. proposed a long time ago
but never accepted). The latest status in the list is assumed current.

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
