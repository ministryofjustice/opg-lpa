# 0014. Implement process for handling Renovate PRs

Date: 2025-10-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a clear process for handling Renovate PRs. Our goals are to:

- Reduce duplicative effort
- Have no undue friction to merging changes
- Clearly document which upgrades are blocked and why

## Decision

We will implement the following workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    START(PR created) --> ASSIGN[Assign yourself to the PR]
    ASSIGN --> BUILDS{Is the PR building correctly?}
    BUILDS -->|Yes| MERGE[Merge PR]
        MERGE --> END(Done)
    BUILDS -->|No| TRIVIAL{Is it a trivial fix?}
    TRIVIAL --> |Yes| FIX[Fix it]
        FIX --> MERGE
    TRIVIAL --> |No| CANFIX{Is it possible to fix?}
    CANFIX --> |No| IGNORE[Ignore in renovate.json with explanation]
        IGNORE --> END
    CANFIX --> |Yes| JIRA[Create ticket in Jira]
        JIRA --> PR_LINK[Add link to Jira ticket on PR]
        PR_LINK --> PR_LABEL[Add 'stop-updating' label to PR]
        PR_LABEL --> END
```

## Consequences

This workflow ensures everyone can see who has picked up the work, and introduces a clear workflow for documenting and tracking complicated updates in Jira. Simple updates be merged with minimal effort.
