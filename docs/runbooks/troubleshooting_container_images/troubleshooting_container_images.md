## Introduction

Sometimes, when circleci builds docker images,it may produce results that are different or unexpected to what you are seeing on your local machine. Reasons this may happen include:

- Issues with composer.lock, either changed or not present.
- Docker images e.g. php, python are pulled from the `:latest` tag and a breaking update happens to the image.
- Issues with `npm, grunt or gulp` for example.

You may want to debug the images generated in more detail, perhaps even go through the approach that circleci uses, but locally. This doc helps you do that.

**Note:** this guide is not exhaustive, so please add items for new scenarios.

## Prerequisites

you will need:

- aws-vault.
- profile in the `~/.aws/config/` that is a dev operator.
- AWS CLI (v1) - as this is in use on circle right now.
- Docker Desktop for Mac
- PHPStorm

please see [Setting up AWS Credentials](../setting-up-aws-credentials/setting-up-credentials.md) for details of how to set up aws cli and aws-vault on your local machine.

## Scenarios

Here's a number of things that will help when debugging a container issue:

- If an issue was spotted in PHPUnit tests in circle CI, you could [Build the dockerfile locally](#build-dockerfile-locally)
- If an issue was spotted after the container was pushed, and later spun up you can also [Pull the existing ECR image](#pull-an-existing-ecr-image)
- For a quick dignostic of the unit tests on the container: [Run PHPUnit directly on the container](#run-phpunit-directly-on-the-container)
- To run the container in PHP Storm: [Set up individual docker run configuration for PHPStorm](#set-up-individual-docker-run-configuration-for-phpstorm)
- To deep debug the tests on container: [Setting up debugging of PHPUnit tests in PHPStorm](#setting-up-debugging-of-phpunit-tests-in-phpstorm)

## Build dockerfile locally

Build the dockerfile for container image you wish to debug - it's best to keep names as per how the circleci produces, if you want to mirror the CI process.

 ``` bash
 docker build -f service-front/docker/app/Dockerfile --progress=plain --no-cache -t 311462405659.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/online-lpa/api_app
 ```

## Pull an existing ECR image

Login to ECR and pull the container using the following commands. You can also replace the `:latest` with a specific tag; e.g. `master-<commit-id>` where `commit-id` is the commit that generated the build, so you can pinpoint a specific image:

``` bash
aws-vault exec moj-lpa-dev --  aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 311462405659.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
docker pull 311462405659.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/online-lpa/api_app:latest
```

## Run PHPUnit directly on the container

run the image up, enable xdebug on the container and run the tests, using the following commands:

``` bash
docker run -d --env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='-' --env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='-' --name api-tests 311462405659.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/online-lpa/api_app:latest
docker exec tests docker-php-ext-enable xdebug
docker exec tests /app/vendor/bin/phpunit

```

## Set up individual docker run configuration for PHPStorm

1 . set up PHPStorm to attach to your new image using a docker debug configuration

   1. in the configuration dropdown (top corner where the play and debug buttons are) select `Edit configurations..`
   2. hit the `+` and add a `Dockerfile` configuration
   3. set image name (as in previous step)
   4. set container name as set in previous step
   5. you may need to set AWS environment variables - these should be all you need:
      1. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='-'; AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='-'`
   6. in the command preview you will see the constructed command look like this:

``` bash
    docker run -P --env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='-' --env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='-' --name api-tests 311462405659.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/online-lpa/api_app:latest
```

## Setting up debugging of PHPUnit tests in PHPStorm

this is currently quite involved so we may want to add this as an option to the .idea files.

This consists of 3 main steps:

- Creating the configuration for PHPUnit debugging.
- Setting up a PHP interpreter.
- Creating the remote interpreter for the test framework.

### Create the configuration

1. in the configuration dropdown (top corner where the play and debug buttons are) select `Edit configurations..`
2. hit the `+` in the `Run/Debug Configurations` dialog and add a `PHPUnit` configuration.
3. select `Test Runner` option to be `Defined in the configuration file`
4. check the `Use alternative configuration file:` and enter the path for your phpunit.xml
5. this is usually in the root of the service your debugging on your source code. e.g `<source-root>/opg-lpa/service-api`

### Configure the remote interpreter

1. in the `Command Line` section, you will need to set up the docker container to be the interpreter. This is similar to the existing docker-compose setup
2. open `...` next to the `Interpreter:` dropdown
3. in the `CLI Interpreters` dialog, hit the `+` to add `From Docker, Vagrant,VM, WSL, Remote...`
4. the dialog will pop up and select the `Docker` radio button.
5. in the `image name:` select the tag of the image you want to debug, click ok.
6. you will have to find the debugger extension path in the container.
7. connect to a running instance of the image above to work this out.

    ``` bash
    docker run -d --env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='-' --env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='-' --name tests2 311462405659.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/online-lpa/api_app:latest
    docker exec -it tests2 sh
    ```

8. at the `/app #` prompt enter `cd /usr/local/lib/php/extensions/` then enter `ls`.
9. you will see a folder labelled something similar to: `no-debug-non-zts-<YYYYMMDD>`, `cd` into it.
10. Take the entire folder path, appending `/xdebug.so` and paste it into the `Debugger extension:` field in the open dialog in PHP Storm, for example `/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20180731/xdebug.so` (the path for PHP 7.4)
11. Before hitting Apply in PHP storm, `exit` the shell and stop the container e.g. `docker stop api-tests`
12. Hit Apply and OK.

### Configure the remote interpreter for the test framework

1. Set up the test framework by selecting the cog icon on the right of the `Use alternative configuration file:` text box.
2. Click `+` in the `Test Frameworks` dialog that appears
3. Select Configuration Type as `PHPUnit by Remote Interpreter`
4. In the `PHP by Remote Interpreter` dialog selct your previously created interpreter option, most likley named the same as you container image tag., and click `OK`
5. Click the folder icon on the Docker container>remove volume from the docker container settings using the folder icon, and replace with a new entry mapping your root of your service codebase e.g. `/users/myusername/opg-lpa/service-api` to `/app`
6. This should change the path mappings to something similar to `<Project root>/service-api -> /app`
7. Under the `PHPUnit library` section set the `Path to script` folder to `/app/vendor/autoload.php`
8. Click OK.
9. You should now be able to set breakpoints and debug the PHPUnit tests.
