# People to notify

The donor can choose people to be told when the [applicant](/help/#topic-applicant) applies to register the LPA. We call these 'people to notify'.

Having people to notify is optional.

## Why notify people?

Letting people know about the LPA when it’s about to be registered provides extra security. It gives people who know the donor well a chance to raise concerns.

Having people to notify can be particularly important if there's a long time between making the LPA and registering it.

## Choose people to notify

The donor can choose up to 5 people to notify. They cannot be the attorneys or replacement attorneys. Many donors choose family members or close friends.

The donor should talk to each person they want to choose to make sure they’re happy to be named on the LPA. During the conversation, the donor should explain that people to notify:

* do not have to do anything right away
* will only be notified when the donor or the attorneys apply to register the LPA
* do not have to do anything when they are contacted, unless they have concerns

## How to notify people

Once you finish making the LPA online, you’ll be able to download the LPA and a people to notify form (LP3).

Most of the form will already have been completed, but the applicant must add:

* the date the form will be given or sent to the person to notify (on page 1)
* the date the donor signed the LPA (on page 2)

Just before the applicant sends the LPA for registration, they must give or send an LP3 form to each of the people to notify.

If the applicant is applying to register 2 LPAs for the donor and the people to notify are the same on both, the applicant must send each person a LP3 form for each LPA.

The LP3 form explains on what grounds someone can object to an LPA being registered and how to raise a concern.

## Where there are reasons to object to the LPA

If a person to notify wants to raise concerns about the LPA, they have 3 weeks from the date they were notified to send their objection to the Office of the Public Guardian.

There are rules about the sorts of concerns people can raise. They cannot object to the LPA simply because they do not like it. People can only object to an LPA on 'factual grounds' or 'prescribed grounds'.

### Factual grounds

A person to notify can object to an LPA's registration if:

* the donor or an attorney has died
* the donor and an attorney were married or had a civil partnership, and the relationship has legally ended
* an attorney does not have mental capacity
* an attorney has decided they do not want to be an attorney anymore (known as 'disclaiming their appointment')
* the donor or an attorney is bankrupt, interim bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order (this only applies to property and financial affairs LPAs)

### Prescribed grounds

A person to notify can object to an LPA's registration if:

* there was fraud or undue pressure on the donor to make the LPA
* the LPA is not legally valid – for example, if they believe the donor did not have mental capacity when the LPA was signed
* the donor cancelled their LPA when they had mental capacity to do so
* an attorney is acting above their authority or against the donor’s best interests (or the person to notify knows that the attorney intends to do this)
