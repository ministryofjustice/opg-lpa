# What is an LPA?

A lasting power of attorney (LPA) is a legal document that lets someone (the '[donor](/help/#topic-donor)') choose one or more trusted people ('[attorneys](/help/#topic-attorneys)') to make decisions on their behalf.

An LPA gives the donor more control over what happens to them if they have an accident or illness that means they cannot make their own decisions (they ‘lack [mental capacity](/help/#topic-mental-capacity)’).

The attorneys must always:

* act in the donor’s best interests
* follow any instructions the donor put in their LPA
* consider any preferences the donor put in their LPA

The donor can make their LPA themselves or ask someone to help them make it.

## The 2 types of LPA

There are [2 types of LPA](/help/#topic-the-2-types-of-lpa). An LPA can be made to cover the donor’s property and financial affairs or their health and welfare.

The donor can make one or both of the LPAs. The LPAs do not have to be made at the same time.

## Registering an LPA

All LPAs must be [registered](/help/#topic-how-to-register-the-lpa) by the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG).
Before registering an LPA, OPG:

* checks that the LPA is legally correct
* checks that there are no errors
* gives people the opportunity to object if they have concerns about the LPA

It takes between 8 and 10 weeks to register an LPA if there are no mistakes in the application and no objections.

## When an LPA can be used

After it’s been registered, a health and welfare LPA can only be used once the donor has lost mental capacity.

When the donor makes a property and financial affairs LPA, they can decide whether it can be used:

* as soon as it’s registered
* only when they have lost mental capacity

## A registered LPA can be ended

As long as the donor still has mental capacity, they can contact OPG and ask for their LPA to be ended or for a particular attorney to be removed.

If the donor has lost mental capacity and anyone has concerns about the attorneys, OPG will investigate or work with other organisations to address complaints.
