# Mental capacity

## What is mental capacity?

A person with mental capacity is able to make a specific decision at the time it needs to be made. They will have at least some understanding of:

* the decision they need to make
* why they need to make it
* any information relevant to the decision
* what is likely to happen when they make it

They should be able to communicate their decision through speech, signs or in other ways.

Whether or not the donor has mental capacity can affect whether an LPA can be made and [when it can be used](/help/#topic-when-an-lpa-can-be-used).

## Mental capacity is not always fixed

A person may have the mental capacity to make some decisions but not others. For example, they may be able to decide what to buy for dinner but be unable to understand and arrange their home insurance.

If someone’s condition changes day-to-day, there may be times when they have mental capacity to make a decision and times when they do not.

A person can also temporarily lack mental capacity, for example if they are unconscious.

## Assessing mental capacity

A health and welfare LPA can only be used after it’s been registered and if the donor does not have mental capacity.

With a property and financial affairs LPA, the donor can decide whether it can be used:

* as soon as it’s registered
* only when they have lost mental capacity

In the [preferences and instructions](/help/#topic-preferences-and-instructions) section of the LPA, the donor can  say how their mental capacity should be assessed. However, if the donor trusts their attorneys to assess their mental capacity, they do not need to add instructions.

Example instructions:

My attorneys shall only act under this power if they have obtained a written medical opinion stating that I am no longer mentally capable of managing and administering my property and financial affairs.

or:

This lasting power of attorney only applies if my GP or another doctor confirms in writing that I do not have capacity to make specific decisions about my medical treatment.
