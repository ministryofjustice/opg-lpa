## Sign the LPA in the right order

The different sections of the LPA must be signed in the right order. If they're not, we cannot register the LPA and the donor may have to pay the application fee again.

Sections must be signed in this order:

1. The donor signs and dates:
    * continuation sheets 1 and 2, if used
    * section 5, if it’s a health and welfare LPA
    * section 9, followed by their witness
2. The certificate provider signs and dates section 10
3. The attorneys and any replacement attorneys sign and date section 11, followed by their witnesses
4. The [person applying to register the LPA](/help/#topic-applicant) (either the donor or attorney) signs and dates section 15

If the attorneys are appointed jointly and they are applying to register the LPA, they all need to sign section 15.

If the attorneys are appointed jointly and severally, or jointly for some decisions, only one attorney needs to sign section 15.

Everyone can sign the LPA on the same day or different days, as long as people sign in the right order.

## Who can be a witness?

Witnesses are impartial people who watch the donor, attorneys and any replacement attorneys sign the LPA. The witnesses must also sign the LPA to say they've seen the donor and attorneys sign.

A witness can be:

* anyone aged 18 or over, apart from the donor
* the certificate provider and any ‘people to notify’

Attorneys or replacement attorneys can witness each other’s signature but not the donor’s.

Witnesses must give their full name and address wherever they sign the form.

## If the donor cannot sign or make a mark

If someone is signing a property and financial affairs LPA on the donor’s behalf, they must sign continuation sheet 3 before the certificate provider signs section 10.

If someone is signing a health and welfare LPA on the donor’s behalf, they must sign continuation sheet 3 and section 5 on the same day. This must be done before the certificate provider signs section 10.

## Check your signing dates

Once you’ve completed your LPA, you'll see a link to the ‘check signing dates’ service on the [your LPAs](/user/dashboard) page.

You can use this service to check the LPA has been signed in the correct order, before you send it for registration.

If you find that the LPA has been signed in the wrong order, you should print the document again and get the relevant people to sign it in the right order. [If you make a mistake](/help/#topic-if-you-find-a-mistake), do not use correction fluid (Tippex).

If you send your LPA to us and it’s signed in the wrong order, we cannot register it. You’ll have to complete some or all it again and the donor may have to pay another application fee.
