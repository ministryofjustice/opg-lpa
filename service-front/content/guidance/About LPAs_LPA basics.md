# LPA basics

A lasting power of attorney (LPA) is a legal document that lets you (the 'donor') choose trusted people ('attorneys') to make decisions on your behalf.

An LPA is mainly used if you don't have the mental capacity to make decisions yourself.

You can only make an LPA for England and Wales – your LPA may not be recognised in other countries. There’s a different process in <a href="http://www.publicguardian-scotland.gov.uk/power-of-attorney" target="_blank">Scotland</a> and <a href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/managing-your-affairs-and-enduring-power-of-attorney" target="_blank">Northern Ireland</a>.
You don’t need to be a British citizen or live in the UK to make an LPA.

## Mental capacity: definition

### What is mental capacity?

‘Mental capacity’ means the ability to make a specific decision at the time it needs to be made. A person with mental capacity has at least a general understanding of:

* the decision they need to make
* why they need to make it
* any information relevant to the decision
* what is likely to happen when they make it

They should be able to communicate their decision through speech, signs, gestures or in other ways. People can sometimes make certain decisions but don’t have the mental capacity to make others. For example, someone may be able to decide what to buy for dinner but be unable to understand and arrange their home insurance.

### Assessing mental capacity

To work out whether someone lacks the mental capacity to make a decision, you need to answer ‘yes’ to these two questions:

1. Do they have a mental or brain problem that stops their brain or mind from working properly?
2. Is that problem causing them such difficulty now that they are unable to make this particular decision at the time it needs to be made?

Being ‘unable to make this particular decision’ means that the person can’t:

* understand relevant information about the decision that needs making
* keep that information in their mind long enough to make the decision
* weigh up the information in order to make the decision
* communicate their decision - this could be by talking, using sign language, pictures, or even squeezing a hand or blinking


## What an LPA covers

There are 2 types of LPA:

### Property and financial affairs

This LPA covers your money and property. You don't have to own your own home or have a lot of money to make this type of LPA. It can be used on your behalf, with your consent, as soon as it's registered. However, you can state that it will only be used if you don't have mental capacity.

### Health and welfare

This LPA covers your personal and health care. This type of LPA can only be used if you don't have the mental capacity to make decisions yourself.

You can use it to let your attorneys decide about your daily routine, such as what you wear and eat, moving into a care home or getting help from social services. You can also give your attorneys the power to refuse or agree to any medical treatment you may need to stay alive, if ever you are unable to make that decision. If your attorneys don't have that power, doctors would decide.

Some people make one type of LPA, while others make both. You'll find more information about the 2 types of LPA when you're asked to choose which type to make.

## Protecting your interests

Your attorneys must always act in your best interests and follow any instructions you give them about making decisions. These instructions can include specifying decisions that you don’t want them to make or they can say how you want them to make particular decisions.

For example, you could state that your attorneys cannot sell your property, or that if they decide to change any of your existing investments they must first consult a financial adviser. You can also include preferences to guide attorneys' decision-making in a way that reflects your beliefs and values.

Your attorneys can only make decisions that are within the authority given by the type of LPA you create. For example, if your LPA is for your property and financial affairs, your attorneys can't make decisions about your care or where you live. If your LPA is for your health and welfare, they can't make decisions about your money.

If you register your LPA and later change your mind you can cancel it, as long as you still have mental capacity. Or, in some situations, you may be able to keep the LPA but remove a particular attorney.

If you have lost your mental capacity and others have concerns about your attorneys, OPG will investigate or work with other organisations to address complaints.

### Code of practice

Attorneys must follow the <a href="
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice" rel="external" target="_blank">Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice</a>. The principles of the code are:

1. Your attorneys must assume that you can make your own decisions unless they establish that you can't do so.
2. Your attorneys must help you to make as many of your own decisions as you can. They must take all practical steps to help you to make a decision. They can only treat you as unable to make a decision if they have taken those steps without success.
3. Your attorneys must not treat you as unable to make a decision simply because you make an unwise decision.
4. Your attorneys must act and make decisions in your best interests when you are unable to make a decision.
5. Before your attorneys make a decision or act for you, they must consider whether they can achieve the same result without restricting your rights and freedoms so much.

## Safeguards

An LPA can't be used by your attorneys until it's been registered by the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG). Before an LPA is registered, OPG must be sure that:

* the LPA is legally correct
* the LPA has no errors
* people have had the opportunity to object if they have concerns

OPG can ask the Court of Protection to remove invalid preferences and instructions so that an LPA can be registered.

OPG protects people who don't have the mental capacity to make decisions for themselves. If someone raises concerns about how an attorney is acting under an LPA, OPG will investigate or work with other organisations to address complaints.
