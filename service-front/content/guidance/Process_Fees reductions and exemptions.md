## Fees, reductions and exemptions

It costs £82 to apply to register an LPA. This can be paid by cheque or online by card.

This fee covers the cost of processing your application, not just registering the LPA.

### Reductions and exemptions

If the donor has a low income or gets certain means-tested benefits, you can apply for them to pay a lower fee or no fee.

1. If the donor receives certain means-tested benefits, they will not have to pay a fee - this is called an 'exemption'.
2. If the donor’s income before tax is less than £12,000 a year, they only have to pay half the fee - a ‘remission'.
3. If the donor gets Universal Credit, they may be entitled to a remission.

It’s only the donor’s benefits and income that are considered. If an attorney is applying to register the LPA, their benefits and income are not taken into account. The attorney can pay the fee and reclaim it from the donor.

#### How to apply for a reduction

When you’re making the LPA, you’ll be asked if the donor wants to apply to pay a reduced or no fee. If you answer yes, once you’ve finished making the LPA, you’ll be able to download a ‘fee remissions and exemption form’ (LPA120). You must sign and date the form.

When you post the LPA to OPG for registration, include:

* the  form
* proof of the donor’s benefits or low income

Everything should be sent together in the same envelope.

### Means-tested benefits: no fee

If the donor gets any of these means-tested benefits, they do not have to pay a fee :

* Income Support
* Income-based Employment and Support Allowance
* Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance
* Guarantee Credit element of State Pension Credit
* both Working Tax Credit and at least one of:
    * Child Tax Credit
    * Disability Element of Working Tax Credit
    * Severe Disability Element of Working Tax Credit
* Housing Benefit
* Council Tax Support or Council Tax Reduction (not the 25% single person reduction or the Class U exemption)
* Local Housing Allowance

If the donor has been awarded personal injury damages of more than £16,000, they cannot get an exemption, even if the damages were ignored when the donor was assessed for a benefit.

Disability Living Allowance, Invalidity Benefit and Personal Independence Payment do not allow the donor to get an exemption from paying the fee.

#### Proof of benefits

You have to prove that the donor gets one of the relevant benefits. Your proof should be a recent letter from either:

* the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)
* another relevant benefit provider

The letter must:

* confirm that the donor is getting the benefit at the time the LPA is sent to OPG for registration
* include the donor’s title, full name and address including postcode

### Low income: reduced fee

If the donor has a gross annual income of less than £12,000, they are eligible to pay only half the fee.

Gross annual income is income before tax. It's not just salary or wages – income may come from different sources, such as:

* non-means-tested benefits (for example, Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance)
* pensions
* interest from investments
* rental income from property

#### Proof of low income

You have to send OPG documents that prove the donor has a low income.

For example, you could send photocopies of:

* 3 months' consecutive wage slips or a P60
* statements from a pension provider
* a recent tax return if the donor is self-employed
* statements or vouchers showing interest from capital, stocks, shares or bonds

You can also send an official letter or notice from the payer of non-means-tested benefits.

The documents you send must:

* include the donor’s title and full name
* include the donor’s address including postcode
* be from, or cover, the current tax year - tax years run from 6 April one year to 5 April the next year

If the donor does not have any income, you have to send OPG a signed statement from the donor explaining how the donor supports themselves.

### Universal Credit: reduced fee

If the donor receives Universal Credit, they may be able to pay a reduced fee.

Because Universal Credit is in its trial phase and replaces several existing benefits, we have to look at the fee reduction application before we can say how much the donor will have to pay.

If you state that the donor gets Universal Credit, we will not ask you to pay until we’ve received the LPA and the proof of Universal Credit. We’ll then contact you to let you know how much the donor has to pay and to arrange payment. We aim to do this within 7 working days of getting your application.

#### Proof of Universal Credit

You have to send OPG a copy of the donor’s most recent benefit award letter, to prove they are receiving Universal Credit.
