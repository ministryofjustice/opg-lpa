# The 2 types of LPA

There are 2 types of LPA. Some people make one, while others make both. To make both types of LPA, you need to complete two separate forms. However, the forms are very similar with only a few small, but important, differences.

## Property and financial affairs LPA

You choose people you trust to make decisions on your behalf about money and financial matters, including:

* opening, closing and using your bank or building society accounts
* claiming, receiving and using your benefits, pensions and allowances
* paying household and other bills
* buying and selling your house and other property

The people you choose to make decisions are known as 'attorneys'. You can have one attorney or more.

You don't have to own your own home or have a lot of money to make a property and financial affairs LPA. For example, if it's hard to manage your bank account or bills alone, you may want someone to help.

You can also make a separate LPA for your business affairs if you want different people to make those decisions.

You can choose that your LPA will only be used if you are no longer able to make decisions. Or you can choose that it can be used while you have mental capacity because you want people to help you with your finances.

## Health and welfare LPA

You choose people you trust to make decisions on your behalf about things such as:

* giving or refusing consent to particular types of health care, including medical treatment
* you staying in your own home and getting help and support from social services
* whether you move into residential care and finding a good care home
* day-to-day matters such as your diet, dress or daily routine

The people you choose to make decisions are known as 'attorneys'. You can have one attorney or more.

You must also choose whether your attorneys or your doctors will make decisions if you ever need treatment to stay alive and you aren't capable of deciding.

As a safeguard, a health and welfare LPA can only be used when you don't have the mental capacity to make decisions.

## Health and welfare: other ways to plan

There are other ways to make your views known and help other people make decisions about your health and welfare.

### Advance statement of your preferences and wishes

This is a written statement setting out your preferences and wishes for any care you may need in future. This isn't legally binding but the people looking after you have to take what you say into account when they decide about your best interests. NHS Choices website has <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/end-of-life-care/Pages/advance-statement.aspx" rel="external" target="_blank">information about advance statements.</a>

### Care plan
If you have a long-term health condition, you can create a written care plan with your GP, nurse or social worker that sets out ways of helping you look after yourself on a day-to-day basis. NHS Choices website has <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/Yourhealth/Pages/Careplan.aspx" rel="external" target="_blank">information about care plans.</a>

### Advance decision
This is a legally binding document that allows you to specify types of treatments that you don't want, in case you aren't able to make a decision about them in the future. NHS Choices website has <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/end-of-life-care/Pages/advance-decision-to-refuse-treatment.aspx" rel="external" target="_blank">information about advance decisions.</a>

If you've made an advance decision, you can still make an LPA. If you want the advance decision to be taken into account, you should state this when you have the opportunity to 'add extra instructions' in the preferences and instructions section of your LPA.

When making a health and welfare LPA, you'll have to decide whether your attorneys or your doctors should make decisions about life-sustaining treatment. If you let your attorneys decide about life-sustaining treatments that you've previously made an advance decision about, the LPA will take the place of the advance decision.
