## The 2 types of LPA

There are 2 types of LPA: property and financial affairs, and health and welfare.

The [donor](/help/#topic-donor) can have one or both. The LPAs do not have to be made at the same time and the donor can choose different [attorneys](/help/#topic-attorneys) for each LPA.

### Property and financial affairs

This LPA covers the donor’s money and property.

The donor does not have to own their own home or have a lot of money to make this type of LPA.

#### Decisions the attorneys can make

The donor chooses people they trust (attorneys) to make decisions on their behalf about money and financial matters, such as:

* opening, closing and using their bank or building society accounts
* claiming, receiving and using their benefits, pensions and allowances
* paying household and other bills
* buying and selling their house
* managing their property and investments

The donor can also make a separate LPA for their business affairs if they want different people to make those decisions.

#### When a property and financial affairs LPA can be used

When they make their LPA, the donor can decide whether it can be used:

* as soon as it’s registered
* only when they have lost [mental capacity](/help/#topic-mental-capacity)

### Health and welfare

This LPA covers the donor’s health care and personal welfare.

#### Decisions the attorneys can make

The donor chooses people they trust (attorneys) to make decisions about things such as:

* giving or refusing consent to particular types of health care, including medical treatment
* getting help and support from social services
* where the donor lives - for example, whether the donor stays in their own home or moves into a care home
* finding a good care home or care providers
* day-to-day matters like the donor’s diet, dress or daily routine

A health and welfare attorney might need to spend the donor’s money on things that maintain or improve the donor’s quality of life. This can include:

* hairdressing or new clothes
* decorating the donor’s home or room in a care home
* paying for extra support so the donor can go out more, for example to visit relatives or to go on holiday

The attorney must ask for money from the person in charge of the donor’s funds. In some cases, the same person may be an attorney on both the donor’s financial and property affairs LPA and health and welfare LPA.

#### When a health and welfare LPA can be used

This type of LPA can only be used after it’s been registered and if the donor does not have the [mental capacity](/help/#topic-mental-capacity) to make decisions.

#### Life-sustaining treatment

'Life-sustaining treatment' is medical treatment needed to keep someone alive.

In their LPA, the donor must choose whether their attorneys can give or refuse consent to life-sustaining treatment on their behalf.

There’s more information about this on the [life-sustaining treatment](/help/#topic-life-sustaining-treatment) help page.

#### Advance decision to refuse treatment

An advance decision is a legally binding written statement. It lets someone say what medical treatment they do not want to have in certain situations. It’s sometimes called a ‘living will’.

If the donor already has an advance decision, and then makes a health and welfare LPA, the LPA might take priority when a decision needs to be made about life-sustaining treatment. There’s more information about this on the [life-sustaining treatment](/help/#topic-life-sustaining-treatment) help page.
