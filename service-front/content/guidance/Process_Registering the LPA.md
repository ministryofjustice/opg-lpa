# Registering the LPA

You can apply to register the LPA when you have filled in and printed the LPA document and you, your certificate provider(s), your attorneys and the witnesses have signed it.

To apply to register the LPA:

1. Using this tool, complete a registration form (this form, the LPA002, is different from the LPA itself).
2. Pay the application fee online or by cheque.
3. Print and sign the form.
4. Send it to the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) with the signed LPA document.

Don't make any changes to the LPA document after you've signed it. That could make it invalid, so you'd have to print it again and get everyone to sign it again.

Before you register, this digital tool will ask you questions about things such as signing and notification dates to make sure everything is correct.

Once that's done, you can pay the £110 application fee online or by cheque. If you get means-tested benefits or have a low income, you may be able to pay less or no fee. [Fees and reductions](/help/#topic-fees-and-reductions) has more information.

Once you've paid:

1. Print the registration form (LPA002). The tool will have automatically filled it in for you.
2. Sign the form.
2. Send it with your signed LPA document to the OPG.

OPG will check the LPA to make sure there are no errors. It will then register and stamp your LPA and return it to you. This takes between 8 and 10 weeks.

## Why you should register your LPA

Your attorneys can only use your LPA to make decisions on your behalf after OPG has registered it and sent it back to you officially stamped.

If you register your LPA as soon as it is signed, OPG can spot mistakes while they can still be changed. If there are any errors, you may have to make all or part of the LPA again. You can only do that if you still have mental capacity. However, you don't have to register your LPA straight away.

If you no longer have mental capacity, your attorneys can apply to register your LPA – however, it won't be possible to correct any errors. If there are mistakes, OPG can't register the LPA and the LPA can't be used. Your attorneys – or someone else – will have to apply to the Court of Protection to get the power to make decisions on your behalf or get a declaration that the LPA can be treated as valid. This can be a long process and can cost a lot more than an LPA.

### The information you'll need to fill in

This registration tool will ask you:

* who is applying to register the LPA – this will be you (the donor) or at least one of the attorneys
* the correspondence address – give details of where OPG should write or phone while your application is processed
* the dates the LPA was signed – give the dates when you, the certificate provider(s) and attorneys signed the printed LPA document
* the dates you notified your 'people to be told' – if you named 'people to be told' when making your LPA, then you must send them the notification forms before you apply to register
* other powers of attorney – give details of any enduring power of attorney (EPA) or registered LPA that you've made as a donor

The rest of the details will be completed automatically for you.

### Print it, sign it and send it

Once you've filled everything in, print out the registration form and sign it.

You need a PDF reader like Adobe Reader (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/reader.html" rel="external" target="_blank">www.adobe.com/uk/products/reader.html</a>) to view and print the LPA forms.

Send the following documents to OPG:

1. the signed LPA document. You must include pages 1 and 2, which are important parts of the form, and any continuation sheets that have been printed and signed.
2. The signed 'Application to register a lasting power of attorney' form (LPA002). You can download this when you have answered the questions.

If you want to apply to pay lower or no application fees, you must include:

1. The signed 'Application for exemption or remission of EPA/LPA application to register fees' form (LPA120A). You can download this at the same time as you download the application to register form.
2. Proof that you should pay less or don't have to pay at all.

See [Fees and reductions](/help/#topic-fees-and-reductions) to find out if you can pay less.

### What happens when OPG gets your LPA?

If you (the donor), are applying to register the LPA, OPG lets the attorneys know about the application. If an attorney is applying, OPG tells you and any other attorneys.

OPG then processes the LPA and holds it for at least 4 weeks.

The 4-week wait is set by law. It gives people time to raise concerns they have about the LPA: for example, if they think you're being forced into making it or that someone is committing fraud.

OPG also uses the time to check that the LPA has been made correctly and there's nothing that would make it invalid or unworkable. If there is something that must be corrected before it can be registered, OPG will contact you.

The registered LPA document that OPG sends you is the same form that you filled in and sent to OPG – but you will see it's been stamped, once OPG's registered it.
