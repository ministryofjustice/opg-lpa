# If you find a mistake

When you’ve finished creating the LPA online, we'll ask you to confirm all the information you've entered is correct. Once you’ve confirmed this, you cannot make any more changes to that LPA.

If you later find a mistake, you'll need to create a new LPA. You can [view your LPAs](https://www.lastingpowerofattorney.service.gov.uk/user/dashboard) and reuse the information you've already entered.

If you’ve already paid the application fee online, we’ll refund it as long as you only post us the new LPA.

Do not use correction fluid (‘Tippex’) to correct a mistake. If you do, we will not be able to register the LPA.
