## If you find a mistake

When you’ve finished creating the LPA online, we'll ask you to confirm all the information you've entered is correct. Once you’ve confirmed this, you cannot make any more changes to that LPA online.

If you find a mistake, do not use correction fluid (‘Tippex’) to correct it. If you do, we will not be able to register the LPA.

There are options for you to make corrections:

*   Make a new LPA. You can [view your LPAs](/user/dashboard), reuse the information you've already entered in an existing LPA and amend the details that were initially incorrect.

    Only post us the new LPA application.

    If you paid the application fee for the incorrect LPA online, we’ll refund it automatically if we don’t receive it after 42 days.

*   Cross out mistakes with a pen and write the correct details as close to the relevant box as possible. Everyone involved in each section must initial each change.
