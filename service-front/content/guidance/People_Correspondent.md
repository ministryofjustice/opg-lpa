The correspondent is the person we’ll send the LPA to once it is registered.

They’re also the person we’ll contact if we need to:

* give an update on the progress of the LPA application
* explain that we’ve found a mistake on the LPA and what needs to be done to correct it
* ask a question about the LPA

### Who can be the correspondent

The correspondent can be:

* the donor or one of their attorneys
* someone else, for example a solicitor or other legal professional

There can only be one correspondent for each LPA application.
