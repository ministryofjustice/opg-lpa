# How multiple attorneys make decisions

If you have more than one attorney, you must decide whether you want them to make some or all decisions on their own or whether they should agree some or all decisions unanimously. The legal terms are 'severally' and 'jointly'.

Your options are:

*	jointly and severally
*	jointly
*	jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for other decisions

Most people choose jointly and severally because it is the most flexible and practical way for attorneys to make decisions.

Whichever way you appoint your attorneys to act, they must always act in your best interests and make every effort to find out whether you can make a decision before they do.

Each choice is explained below. If you are not sure which option is best for your circumstances, then you can get legal advice.

## Jointly and severally (attorneys act either together or individually)

Your attorneys can make decisions on your behalf on their own or together.

Any action taken by any attorney alone is as valid as if they were the only attorney. It's up to your attorneys to choose how they make decisions but they must always act in your best interests.

Most people choose this option because:

*	attorneys can make simple or urgent decisions quickly and easily
*	if an attorney can no longer act, the LPA won't be cancelled

It is possible for one attorney to make decisions for you without asking your other attorneys.

If you choose this option, you must not say anywhere else in the LPA that certain decisions must be made by:

*	one particular attorney
*	some or all of your attorneys
*	a minimum number of attorneys

You can say how you’d like your attorneys to make a particular decision in the preferences section of your LPA. However, they don’t have to follow your preferences.

See [Preferences and instructions](/help/#topic-preferences-and-instructions) for more information.

## Jointly (attorneys agree every decision unanimously)

Your attorneys must always make all decisions together. They must agree unanimously and they must all sign any relevant documents.

Choose this option if you want your attorneys to agree on every decision, regardless of how large or small it is.

With this option:

*   if your attorneys can’t all agree on a decision, it can’t be made
*	if your attorneys can’t work together, your LPA won’t work
*	if one attorney can no longer act or dies, your LPA will stop working, unless you’ve appointed replacements or unless stated otherwise in [instructions](/help/#topic-preferences-and-instructions)
*   your attorneys may not be able to use internet or telephone banking to manage your bank accounts

If you have appointed replacement attorneys, they all take over if one of your original attorneys can no longer act – your original attorneys stop acting for you. This is because the law treats attorneys who act jointly as a single unit.

## Jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for other decisions

Your attorneys must make certain decisions together and agree them unanimously – but they can make other decisions individually.

If you choose this option you must clearly state which decisions your attorneys should make together and agree unanimously: that is, when they should act jointly.

Some people pick this option because they don’t mind their attorneys taking everyday decisions alone but want them to make important decisions together, such as selling a house.

With this option:

*	if your attorneys can’t agree on a joint decision, it can’t be made
*	if one attorney can no longer act or dies, your remaining attorneys won't be able to make any of the joint decisions, unless you’ve appointed replacements

If one attorney can no longer act and you’ve appointed replacements:

*	the replacement attorneys take over making all joint decisions from your original attorneys
*	the replacement and remaining original attorneys can make any decisions they’re allowed to make individually

### Examples of working jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for others

Property and financial affairs LPA examples:

> My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions about selling or letting my house and may act jointly and severally for everything else.

> My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions about investments in stocks and shares and may act jointly and severally for everything else.

In the first example, 'everything else' means all financial decisions apart from selling or letting your house. In the second example, 'everything else' means all money matters apart from investing in stocks and shares.

Health and welfare LPA examples:

> My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions about where I live and may act jointly and severally for everything else.

> My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions I have authorised them to make about life-sustaining treatment and may act jointly and severally for everything else.

In both examples, 'everything else' means all decisions about your day-to-day care and medical treatment, except specific life-sustaining treatment decisions.

### Questions to ask yourself

* Do you trust each of your attorneys to make decisions in your best interests? If not, are these the right attorneys?
* Do your attorneys know what you would decide if you could?
* What might stop your attorneys working together? Do they get on? What would happen if they fell out?
* Even if your attorneys can make most decisions on their own, are there some big decisions that you want them to agree on?
* Do you want your attorneys or replacement attorneys to make all their decisions together and agree everything unanimously?
* Are you happy for your attorneys to choose whether they make decisions together or individually?
* Do your attorneys understand how you would like them to make decisions?
* Do you know what will happen if one attorney can't act any more?
* Do you want replacement attorneys? They're an important backup if your attorneys have to make some or all decisions together.
