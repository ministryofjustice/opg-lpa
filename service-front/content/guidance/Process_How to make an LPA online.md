# How to make an LPA online

This online service helps you make a lasting power of attorney (LPA) that you can post to Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) for registration. An LPA can only be used once OPG have registered it.

The donor can use the service to make their LPA themselves or ask someone to help them make it.

You'll be asked some questions and we'll use your answers to create an LPA that you can print, get everyone to sign, and then post to OPG for registration.

You cannot complete the whole process online as the law says that an LPA must be a paper document with handwritten signatures or marks.

We'll save the LPA as you progress so you do not need to make it in one go. You can stop at any time, then come back when you’re ready to continue. You can also [view a draft of the LPA](/help/#topic-how-to-view-a-draft-of-the-lpa) before you finish making it.

You can only make an LPA for England and Wales – your LPA may not be recognised in other countries. There’s a different process in [Scotland](http://www.publicguardian-scotland.gov.uk/power-of-attorney) and [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/managing-your-affairs-and-enduring-power-of-attorney). People involved in the LPA do not need to be British citizens or live in the UK.

## The 3 steps to a registered LPA

1. Make the LPA online and pay the [registration fee](/help/#topic-fees-and-reductions)
2. Print the LPA and get all the required people to sign it in the right order
3. Post the LPA to OPG so we can review and register it

You do not have to register the LPA as soon as you create it, but it's a good idea to. This gives you time to sort out any problems, so the LPA will be ready to use as soon as the donor needs it.
