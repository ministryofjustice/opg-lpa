## Preferences and instructions

The donor can give preferences and instructions to guide and direct the way their attorneys make decisions.

Adding preferences and instructions is optional, and most donors do not add any. Many donors prefer to talk to their attorneys about their wishes in advance, rather than leaving written directions.

When attorneys want to make a decision on the donor’s behalf, they will need to show the registered LPA to organisations, such as banks or care homes. These organisations will check the LPA to see if the donor made any relevant preferences or instructions.

### When instructions must be added

The donor must add instructions if:

* they appointed their attorneys jointly, and want the remaining attorneys to be able to continue make decisions if one of the attorneys dies or is unable to act
* they appointed their attorneys to act jointly for some decisions and jointly and severally for others, and want the remaining attorneys to be able to continue making the joint decisions if one of the attorneys dies or is unable to act
* they’re making a property and finance LPA and the donor has, or wants to have, investments in a discretionary management scheme

You can find more information about these instructions below.

### The difference between preferences and instructions

Instructions are things the donor says their attorneys must or must not do when making decisions on their behalf.

Preferences are things the donor would like their attorneys to think about when making decisions.

The attorneys do not have to follow the donor’s preferences, but they should keep them in mind when making decisions. If the donor definitely wants their attorneys to do something, include it in the instructions.

### Write preferences and instructions carefully

Complicated or badly written preferences and instructions can make an LPA unworkable. If this happens, the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) may not register the LPA or the Court of Protection may need to remove a preference or instruction from the LPA. This can take a long time.

The donor must be careful not to write any instructions that contradict what they’ve said elsewhere in the LPA. The donor must also not write any instructions or preferences that require their attorneys to break the law.

If the donor’s not sure what they can put in their preferences and instructions, they might want to get legal advice.

We’ve included some guidance at bottom of this page to help you avoid some common mistakes.

### Change when and how replacement attorneys step in

If the original attorneys are appointed jointly and severally, the donor can add instructions to state the order in which replacement attorneys should step in.

Find out more and see example instructions on the [replacement attorneys](/help/#topic-replacement-attorneys) help page.

### Change what happens when an attorneys dies or is unable to act

If the original attorneys are appointed jointly or jointly for some decisions, the donor can add instructions to change what happens to their LPA when an original attorney dies or is unable or unwilling to act.

Find out more and see example instructions on the [how multiple attorneys make decisions](/help/#topic-how-multiple-attorneys-make-decisions) help page.

### Preferences on property and financial affairs LPAs

The donor can add preferences about how they’d like their money and property to be managed.

If the donor wants to write preferences, use words such as 'prefer' and 'would like', so it is clear that the donor is giving their attorneys guidance not instructions. Do not use words like 'must' and 'shall'.

Examples:

* I would like to maintain a minimum balance of £1,000 in my current account.
* I prefer to invest in ethical funds.
* I would like my attorneys to consult my doctor if they believe I may not have mental capacity to make decisions about my house.
* I would like to donate £50 each year to Age UK.

### Preferences on health and welfare LPAs

The donor can add preferences about their health, care and welfare. These could include the donor’s preferences on where they’d like to live and who they’d prefer to look after them.

If the donor wants to write preferences, use words such as 'prefer' and 'would like', so it is clear that the donor is giving their attorneys guidance not instructions. Do not use words like 'must' and 'shall'.

Examples:

* I prefer to live within 5 miles of my sister.
* I prefer to be prescribed generic medicine whenever possible.
* I would like to take exercise at least 3 times a week whenever I am physically able to do so.

#### Life-sustaining treatment preferences

If the donor chooses to give their attorneys the power to make decisions about [life-sustaining treatment](/help/#topic-life-sustaining-treatment), they can add preferences about this. This can help attorneys make decisions that are as close as possible to the decisions the donor would have made.

For example, the donor might write something like:

* If I were in the last days of a terminal illness, I would only want treatments to make me comfortable. I would not want treatments to prolong my life or that meant I could not die at home.
* I would like my attorneys to consult my family when making decisions about life-sustaining treatment.

Attorneys should pay attention to the donor’s preferences, though they do not have to follow them.

The donor does not have to give any preferences for life-sustaining treatment – their attorneys can act without them.

### Instructions on property and financial affairs LPAs

The donor can add instructions about how they’d like their money and property to be managed.

If the donor wants to write instructions, use words such as 'must', 'shall' and 'have to'.

Examples:

* My attorneys must continue to make donations to charities that I have previously supported or for which I have set up standing order payments.
* My attorneys must not make any gifts.
* My attorneys must not sell my home unless, in my doctor's opinion, I can no longer live independently.
* My attorneys must send annual accounts to my brother and sister.

#### Discretionary management schemes

A discretionary management scheme (DMS) is a type of investment where investment decisions are taken by the scheme manager, such as a bank.

The donor must include instructions in their property and finance LPA if they:

* have investments in a DMS and want that to continue
* want to allow their attorneys to invest their money in a DMS

In these cases the donor should include instruction wording like this:

"My attorneys may transfer my investments into a discretionary management scheme. Or, if I already had investments in a discretionary management scheme before I lost capacity to make financial decisions, I want the scheme to continue. I understand in both cases that managers of the scheme will make investment decisions and my investments will be held in their names or the names of their nominees."

OPG cannot guarantee that DMSs will accept this wording. The donor may also want to seek legal advice before they speak to their DMS.

If the LPA does not include appropriate instructions about DMSs and the donor has lost capacity, their attorneys will have to apply to the Court of Protection to allow them to use a DMS.

### Instructions on health and welfare LPAs

The donor can add instructions about their health, care and welfare. These could include instructions about where the donor lives and medical treatment that fits with their beliefs.

If the donor wants to write instructions, use words such as 'must', 'shall' and 'have to'.

Examples:

* My attorneys must ensure that I am fed a vegan diet with no animal products.
* I consent to the disclosure to my attorneys of all relevant information concerning me.
* My attorneys must refer to my advance decision to refuse treatment involving blood products, which is against my religion.
* My attorneys must not decide that I am to move into residential care unless my doctor says that I can no longer live independently.

#### Life-sustaining treatment instructions

If the donor chooses to give their attorneys the power to make decisions about [life-sustaining treatment](/help/#topic-life-sustaining-treatment), they can add instructions to specify medical conditions where their attorneys must or must not consent to life-sustaining treatment on the donor behalf.

For example, the donor might write something like:

"My attorneys must not agree to life-sustaining treatment if I am in a persistent vegetative state."

The donor cannot write instructions that would require their attorneys to break the law  – this includes anything to do with euthanasia and assisted suicide. If this sort of instruction is included, OPG may not be able to register the LPA.

The donor does not have to give any instructions for life-sustaining treatment – their attorneys can act without them.

### Avoiding problems with instructions

Instructions and preferences can create problems. It’s easy to ask for something that the law will not allow.

If the donor would like to add instructions and preferences, here are some common mistakes to avoid.

#### Do not add instructions that try to change the way attorneys are appointed to act

The donor must not appoint attorneys to make decisions in one way, then include an instruction that requires the attorneys to make decisions in a different way.

If the donor has chosen to appoint their attorneys to act jointly and severally (the attorneys can make any decision on their own or together), the donor must not add these sort of instructions:

* that one attorney has to do what another attorney says
* that one attorney must deal with the donor’s business and another with their private affairs
* that if the attorneys disagree, the majority should decide
* that attorneys must make some decisions together - if this is what the donor wants, they should appoint their attorneys to act ‘jointly for some decisions and jointly and severally for other decisions’ instead

We cannot register the LPA if it includes instructions like these.

#### Make sure preferences or instructions are for all attorneys

Any preferences or instructions must apply to all the attorneys. The donor must not say, for example, that only their daughter is allowed to sell their house, or that one attorney cannot make decisions about giving gifts.

#### Be careful with gifts

Instructions about gifts often cause problems on property and financial affairs LPAs. This is because there are strict limits on the size and kind of gifts attorneys can give on the donor’s behalf. Attorneys can only:

* give gifts on 'customary occasions', such as weddings, birthdays and religious holidays
* donate to charities the donor has previously given to
* make gifts that are 'reasonable' and take into account how much money the donor has

The donor cannot authorise attorneys to go beyond these limits.

The donor also cannot instruct their attorneys to do things such as:

* giving gifts intended to reduce inheritance tax liability
* creating or contributing to trust funds for grandchildren
* paying school fees for grandchildren
* making interest-free loans to family
* paying maintenance for any family member other than the donor’s wife, husband, civil partner or child under 18

The attorneys must apply to the Court of Protection if they want to make gifts like this on the donor’s behalf.

#### Other common mistakes to avoid

In their instructions, the donor:

* cannot tell their attorneys to do anything against the law – this includes anything to do with euthanasia and assisted suicide
* cannot say that attorneys should act in the best interests of the donor’s wife, husband, partner or children - attorneys act for the donor, not anyone else
* cannot say a [replacement attorney](/help/#topic-replacement-attorneys) can only start acting in specific circumstances. For instance, the donor cannot use instructions to add special circumstances – such as an original attorney being on holiday – in which their replacement attorney can step in
* should not add instructions about their health and welfare to a property and financial affairs LPA
* should not add instructions about their property and finances to a health and welfare LPA
* cannot tell an attorney to change the donor’s will – that’s something outside an attorney’s powers
* cannot give an attorney power to appoint a replacement attorney
