# Attorneys
Attorneys are people you trust and appoint under your LPA to make decisions on your behalf when you don't have mental capacity.

You must have at least one attorney. There's no upper limit but too many attorneys could make things difficult, as they'll need to work together.

You should think about replacement attorneys – people who step in if one of your original attorneys can no longer act. See [Replacement attorneys](/help/#topic-replacement-attorneys) for more information.

## Who can be an attorney

In legal terms, an 'attorney' is a person who's allowed to act on behalf of someone.

Attorneys don't need to be solicitors. Many people choose family members, friends and other people they trust with no legal background. If an attorney is not a professional, the important thing is that you know each other well and they respect your views and  will act in your best interests.

You can ask anyone with mental capacity aged 18 or over to be your attorney, including:

* your wife, husband, civil partner or partner
* a family member
* a close friend
* a professional, such as a solicitor

Make sure that each person agrees to be your attorney before you name them in your LPA.

If you choose your wife, husband or civil partner and your relationship is later legally ended, they will usually have to stop being your attorney. However, you can state in your instructions that they can continue to be your attorney if your relationship legally ends. If you don't and they are your only attorney, your LPA will be cancelled.

A person who is on the Disclosure and Barring Service barred list can't act as an attorney. They're breaking the law if they do.

### Property and financial affairs LPA attorneys

An undischarged bankrupt or a person subject to a debt relief order can't be an attorney for a property and financial affairs LPA. If an attorney becomes bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order after the LPA has been registered, they will no longer be able to act.

Bankruptcy and debt relief orders don't affect health and welfare LPAs.

If you appoint a professional attorney for a property and financial affairs LPA, such as a solicitor, you must name an individual. You can't just give a job title or the name of a firm. Professional attorneys usually charge fees.

### Trust corporation

A trust corporation can be an attorney for a property and financial affairs LPA. A trust corporation manages funds: for example, savings, pensions, investments. It is usually run by a commercial bank or firm of solicitors.

If your finances are complex or you don't have anyone you want to appoint, you might choose a trust corporation. If you're considering this, you should get legal or financial advice.

If you appoint a trust corporation, make sure you use the exact name they operate under in your LPA. You can't appoint more than one trust corporation in your LPA.

### Health and welfare LPA attorneys

An attorney for a health and welfare LPA must be a person. You can have as many attorneys as you need.

## When attorneys can act
Your LPA can only be used after it's been registered by the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG).

There are different rules about when attorneys can start making decisions on your behalf, depending on:

* the type of LPA
* whether you still have the mental capacity to make decisions

[When an LPA can be used](/help/#topic-when-an-lpa-can-be-used) explains the rules for the 2 types of LPA.

### Mental capacity: definition

'Mental capacity' means the ability to make a decision. A person with mental capacity has at least a general understanding of the decision they need to make, why they need to make it and the likely consequences. Sometimes people can make some kinds of decision but don't have the mental capacity to make others.

The Ministry of Justice website has <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/protecting-the-vulnerable/mental-capacity-act" rel="external" target="_blank">more information about mental capacity</a>.

## When attorneys can no longer act

An attorney can no longer act on your behalf if they:

* lose mental capacity
* decide they no longer want to act as your attorney (known as 'disclaiming their appointment')
* were your wife, husband or civil partner but your relationship has legally ended and you've not stated in your LPA restrictions that they can continue
* become bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order and were an attorney for a property and financial affairs LPA

If you've said that your attorneys must act together for some or all decisions, they will not be able to make those decisions if one dies or can no longer act for you for another reason. To protect your LPA, you should consider appointing replacement attorneys.

If you cancel your LPA, your attorneys can no longer act on your behalf.

### Concerns about attorneys

The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) does not supervise attorneys. However, if someone believes your attorneys are not acting in your best interests, they can raise concerns with OPG. OPG or other organisations, such as the police or social services, may investigate.

### Questions to ask yourself

Most donors take some time choosing the best people to be their attorneys. Consider these questions:


* How many attorneys do you want to appoint?
* Are these people willing to act? Have you discussed your LPA fully with them?
* Do they understand the role and responsibilities of an attorney?
* Do you trust them to act in your best interests?
* Do they know you, your beliefs and your preferences well enough to make decisions for you?
* Do they have the skills to act under your LPA and do they manage their own affairs well? For example, are they good with money?
* Who can be your replacement attorneys?
