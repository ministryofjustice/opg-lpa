# When an LPA can be used

## Health and welfare LPA

A health and welfare LPA can only be used after it’s been registered and if the donor does not have the [mental capacity](/help/#topic-mental-capacity) to make decisions.

The attorneys cannot make a decision for the donor when the donor can make that decision themselves.

In the preferences and instructions section, the donor can say how they would like their mental capacity to be assessed. However, if the donor trusts their attorneys to assess their mental capacity, they do not need to add instructions.

## Property and financial affairs LPA

When they make a property and financial affairs LPA, the donor can decide whether it can be used:

* as soon as it’s registered
* only when they have lost [mental capacity](/help/#topic-mental-capacity)

### As soon as it's registered

Most people choose this option as it’s the most practical.

It means that the attorneys can help the donor with their property and financial affairs, now and in the future.

While the donor has mental capacity, the attorneys can only act with the donor’s permission.

This option is useful if the donor is able to make their own decisions but there’s another reason they want their attorneys’ help. For example, if the donor finds it difficult to visit the bank or talk on the phone, they might ask their attorneys to deal with the bank or pay bills.

### Only when the donor does not have mental capacity

This option means that the attorneys can only act on the donor’s behalf after the LPA has been registered and if the donor has lost capacity.

Be careful, as this option can make the LPA a lot less useful. Each time the attorneys try to use the LPA, they might be asked to prove that the donor does not have mental capacity.

In the preferences and instructions section of the LPA, the donor can  say how their mental capacity should be assessed. However, if the donor trusts their attorneys to assess their mental capacity, they do not need to add instructions.
