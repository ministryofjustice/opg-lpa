## How to register the LPA

Once you’ve made the LPA, you need to send it to the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) to be registered. An LPA can only be used after it’s been registered.

### Why you should register the LPA as soon as you can

It’s a good idea to register the LPA as soon as you can. Most people send the LPA to OPG within 2 months of making it.

If you send the LPA to us as soon as it is signed, we can spot mistakes while they can still be changed. If there are any errors, you may have to complete some or all of the LPA again. You can only do that if the donor still has mental capacity.

If the donor no longer has mental capacity, their attorneys can apply to register the LPA, however it will not be possible to correct any errors. If there are mistakes, we cannot register the LPA and it cannot be used. The attorneys – or someone else – will have to apply to the Court of Protection to get the power to make decisions on the donor’s behalf. This can be a long process and can cost a lot more than an LPA.

### How to register the LPA

Once you’ve made the LPA, the online service will take you through the steps to send in the LPA for registration.

1. Pay the application fee online by card - you can also choose to pay by cheque
2. Download and print every page of:
    * the completed LPA form
    * the ‘fee remissions and exemption form’, if you’re applying to pay a reduced or no fee
    * the letter to send to the 'people to notify', if the donor has chosen any
3. Get everyone to [sign the LPA in the right order](/help/#topic-signing-the-lpa). After signing, it’s a good idea to use the ‘check signing dates’ service to make sure the LPA’s been signed correctly.
4. Send the ‘Notice of intention to register an LPA’ letter to each person to notify
5. Post the following things to OPG in one envelope:
    * the signed LPA, including any continuation sheets
    * the ‘fee remissions and exemption form’ and any proof needed, if you’re applying to pay a reduced or no fee
    * a cheque, if you have not paid the fee online

OPG’s address is on the information sheets downloaded with your LPA.

You need a PDF reader like Adobe Reader to view and print the LPA form. You can <a href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/reader.html" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">download Adobe Reader from the Adobe website (opens in new tab)</a>.

#### Track the progress of the LPA after you've posted it

Once you've posted the LPA to us, you can track its progress from the [Your LPAs](/user/dashboard) page. This will let you know when we've received the LPA, when we're checking it, and when we've returned it.

It’s not possible to track the progress of LPAs made before 1 April 2019.


#### What happens when OPG gets your LPA

If the donor is applying to register the LPA, we write to the attorneys to let them know about the application. If an attorney is applying, we write to the donor and any other attorneys.

We then process the LPA and hold it for at least 4 weeks.

This 4 week wait is set by law. It gives people time to raise concerns about the LPA. For example, if they think the donor is being forced into making the LPA or that someone is committing fraud.

We also use the time to check that the LPA has been made correctly and there's nothing that would make it invalid or unworkable. If there is something that must be corrected before the LPA can be registered, we’ll contact [the correspondent](/help/#topic-correspondent).

Once we’ve registered the LPA, we’ll stamp the LPA form you sent us and return it to the correspondent by post.

It takes 8 to 10 weeks in total to register the LPA if there are no mistakes in the application.
