## The donor

The donor is the person who wants to make an LPA so that they can appoint other people to help them make decisions or to make decisions on their behalf. An LPA is for one person only.

A donor must:

* be at least 18 years old
* have [mental capacity](/help/#topic-mental-capacity)

It's OK for the donor to get help making their LPA. Many donors talk to family, friends or a legal adviser. However, the donor must make their own decisions about their LPA. For example, no one else should choose the donor’s attorneys for them.

### List the donor’s other names in the LPA

If the donor uses more than one name or used to be known by a different or maiden name, include a list of these names in the ‘donor details’ section of the LPA.

This will help attorneys deal with banks and other organisations on the donor’s behalf.

### If the donor lives outside England and Wales, or has property outside England and Wales

LPAs cover people who live or have assets in England and Wales. An LPA may not work in other countries, including Scotland and Northern Ireland.

The donor should think about getting legal advice on making an LPA if:

* the donor lives outside England and Wales
* the donor has property outside England and Wales
* the donor is planning to move away from England and Wales
* there are other reasons why where the donor lives could cause complications

### If the donor is bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order

There are rules about bankruptcy and debt relief orders (DROs) for a property and financial affairs LPA.

If the donor is bankrupt or subject to a DRO, they can make, sign and register a property and financial affairs LPA. However, their attorneys will not have power over all the donor’s property.

The donor should think about getting legal advice before they make an LPA.

The LPA will be cancelled if the donor becomes bankrupt or subject to a DRO after their property and financial affairs LPA is made or registered.

Bankruptcy and DROs do not affect a health and welfare LPA.
