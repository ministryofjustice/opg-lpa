# Donor

The donor is the person who makes the LPA. The registered LPA can be used if the donor loses mental capacity.

### Mental capacity: definition

'Mental capacity' means the ability to make a decision. A person with mental capacity has at least a general understanding of the decision they need to make, why they need to make it and what is likely to happen when they've made it. People can sometimes make certain decisions but don't have the mental capacity to make others.

The Ministry of Justice website has <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/protecting-the-vulnerable/mental-capacity-act" rel="external" target="_blank">information about mental capacity</a>.

An LPA is a legal document that allows you (the donor) to choose people – known as your attorneys – to make decisions for you. You can make an LPA for your property and financial affairs, or your health and welfare. Some people choose to make both.

Only you can give others the power to make decisions on your behalf. This applies whether you get help making your LPA or not.

## Who can be a donor
An LPA is for 1 person only. You can make an LPA if:

* you are at least 18 years old
* you have the mental capacity to do so

It's fine to get help when making your LPA. Many people talk to family, friends or a legal advisor. But you alone must make the decisions about your LPA. For example, no one else should choose your attorneys for you.

Most people can make an LPA. However, there could be complications because of:

* residency – if you live or have property outside England and Wales
* bankruptcy – if you are bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order and want to make an LPA for your property and financial affairs

### Residency and property

LPAs cover people who live or have assets in England and Wales. Your LPA may not work in other countries, including Scotland and Northern Ireland. You should think about getting legal advice if:

* you live outside England and Wales
* you have property outside England and Wales
* you're planning to move away from England and Wales
* there are other reasons why where you live complicates your situation

### Bankruptcy and debt relief orders

There are rules about bankruptcy and debt relief orders for a property and financial affairs LPA.

If you are bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order, you can make, sign and register a property and financial affairs LPA. However, your attorneys will not have power over all of your property. If this applies to you, you should think about getting legal advice before you make your LPA.

If you become bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order after your property and financial affairs LPA is made or registered, it will be cancelled.

If an attorney becomes bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order, they can no longer be your attorney under your property and financial affairs LPA.

Bankruptcy does not affect a health and welfare LPA.

## Other names
If you use more than one name or used to be known by a different name, you should make a list of these. This will help your attorneys deal with banks and other organisations on your behalf if your LPA is used.
