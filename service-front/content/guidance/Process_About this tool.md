# About this tool
This digital LPA tool helps you make your lasting power of attorney (LPA).

You'll be asked some questions. For each question, you'll need to give some information or make choices. You'll also find links to detailed guidance.

You can stop at any time and save the information you've entered. You may want to do this if you need to think about a decision or discuss your LPA with someone. Sign back in when you're ready to continue.

With this digital tool:

* you can't complete the whole process online – you need to print and sign your LPA and send it to the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) to be registered
* you can only make an LPA for England and Wales – your LPA may not be recognised in other countries

You need to print your completed LPA document so that you and the other people involved can sign it. The law says that an LPA must be a paper document with handwritten signatures or marks.

If you can't sign or make a mark yourself, you can ask someone else to sign on your behalf.

## The 3 steps

1. Create: make decisions about your LPA, choose the people you want to be involved and print your completed LPA document.
2. Sign: make sure that all the required people sign your LPA document in the correct order. See [Signing the LPA](/help/#topic-signing-the-lpa)

3. Apply to register: fill in more details, pay the application fee and then send the documents to OPG. See [Registering your LPA](/help/#topic-registering-the-lpa)

Apply to register your LPA sooner rather than later, in case there are any problems to sort out before it's registered. Your LPA will then be ready to use as soon as you need it.

## Fees

It costs £110 to register an LPA. Some people qualify for a reduced fee or can pay no fee.

## Before you begin

You need to make quite a few decisions when you make your LPA. You should think about these decisions in advance. It's important to know how your LPA will work and to talk to the people you want to be involved.

### Questions to ask yourself

* Who will be your attorneys? These are the people who act on your behalf under the LPA.
* How many attorneys do you need?
* Should you have replacement attorneys? These are people who step in if original attorneys can no longer act, so they're a way to protect your LPA.
* How should your attorneys make decisions on your behalf? Should they act together or individually, or a mixture of the two?
* Do you want any conditions or restrictions on the way your attorneys make decisions?
* Do you want to give any guidance to your attorneys about how to make decisions?
* Who's the independent person – the certificate provider – who can sign your LPA to confirm that you understand it and no one is forcing you to make it? This person is a safeguard who can raise concerns when you make your LPA.
* Are there any 'people to be told' about your LPA when it is about to be registered? These people are a safeguard who can raise concerns about your LPA before it can be used.
