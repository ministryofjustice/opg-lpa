# Preferences and instructions

You can leave preferences and instructions for your attorneys to direct and guide the way they act, but you don't have to. If you leave this blank, your attorneys will be free to make decisions they think are right.

Complicated or badly written preferences and instructions can make an LPA unworkable. The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) might not register it or the Court of Protection might need to change it. If it goes to the court, the instructions will be 'severed', which means removed from the LPA. This can take a long time.

If you're not sure about what you can put in this section of your LPA, you might want to get legal advice.

### Preferences: definition

This means things you'd like your attorneys to think about when acting under your LPA: your wishes, beliefs and values. Your attorneys don't have to follow this guidance but they should keep it in mind when making decisions for you.

### Instructions: definition

These are things your attorneys must or must not do when making decisions for you.


## Preferences

Avoid words such as 'must' and 'shall'. Instead use words such as 'prefer' and 'would like', so it is clear that you are giving your attorneys advice but not instructions. If you definitely want your attorneys to do something, include it in your instructions.

### Property and financial affairs LPA

You can add preferences about how you'd like, for instance, your bank accounts or tax to be managed.

### Workable examples of property and finance preferences:

* I would like to maintain a minimum balance of £1,000 in my current account.
* I prefer to invest in ethical funds.
* I would like my attorneys to consult my doctor if they believe I may not have mental capacity to make decisions about my house.
* I would like to donate £100 each year to Age UK.

### Health and welfare LPA

You can add preferences, for instance, about where you'd like to live and who you'd prefer to look after you.

You don’t have to leave any preferences. If your attorneys understand your beliefs and values, you may feel there is no need for further guidance in the LPA.

### Workable examples of health and welfare preferences:

* I prefer to live within 5 miles of my sister.
* I prefer to be prescribed generic medicine whenever possible.
* I would like to take exercise at least 3 times a week whenever I am physically able to do so.
* My attorneys should consult my family when making decisions about life-sustaining treatment (use this only if you have chosen option A to allow your attorneys to decide about life-sustaining treatment).


## Instructions

Use words such as 'must', 'shall' and 'have to' when writing instructions for your attorneys.

### Property and financial affairs LPA

You can add instructions about, for instance, managing your bank account or seeking professional advice about your tax.

You must write an instruction if:
* you have investments managed by a bank and want that to continue
* you want to allow your attorneys to let a bank manage your investments

### Workable examples of property and financial affairs instructions:

* My attorneys must continue to make donations to charities that I have previously supported or for which I have set up standing order payments.
* My attorneys must not make any gifts.
* My attorneys must not sell my home unless, in my doctor's opinion, I can no longer live independently.
* My attorneys must send annual accounts to my brothers and sisters.
* My attorney(s) may transfer my investments into a discretionary management scheme. Or, if I already had investments in a discretionary management scheme before I lost capacity to make financial decisions, I want the scheme to continue. I understand in both cases that managers of the scheme will make investment decisions and my investments will be held in their names or the names of their nominees. (There’s no guarantee your banks will accept this wording. You may want to seek legal advice before you write an instruction about a discretionary management scheme).

### Health and welfare LPA

You can add instructions about, for instance, medical treatment that fits with your beliefs.

### Workable examples of health and welfare instructions:

* My attorneys must ensure that I am fed a vegan diet with no animal products.
* I consent to the disclosure to my attorneys of all relevant information concerning me.
* My attorneys must refer to my advance decision to refuse treatment involving blood products, which is against my religion.
* My attorneys must not decide that I am to move into residential care unless my doctor says that I can no longer live independently.

These are just a few examples. Don't add any that aren't right for you. You can make instructions about other things that matter to you.

### If you chose option A, to give your attorneys decisions about life sustaining treatment:

You can specify medical or physical conditions where your attorneys must or must not consent to life-sustaining treatment on your behalf. For example, you can state that your attorneys must not agree to life-sustaining treatment if you are in a persistent vegetative state.

If you have already made an ['advance decision'](/help/#topic-glossary) to refuse a specific life-sustaining treatment, your LPA will override the advance decision if you give your attorneys the power to decide about life-sustaining treatment.

## Avoiding problems

There are things you can't make your attorneys do. If you would like your attorneys to do something that you are not allowed to include as an instruction, you may be able to include it as a preference instead.

### Contradictions
Don't appoint attorneys to make decisions in one way, then include an instruction that makes them act differently.

If you have stated that your attorneys must act jointly and severally – so they can make any decision on your behalf on their own or together – you must not add these sort of instructions:

* that one attorney has to do what another attorney says
* that one attorney must deal with your business and another with your private affairs
* that they must make some decisions together – you should appoint them to act 'jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for other decisions' instead if this is what you want

### Gifts
Instructions about gifts often cause problems. There are strict limits on the kinds of gifts that attorneys can give on your behalf. They can give presents on 'customary occasions', including weddings, birthdays and religious holidays. They can donate to charities you’ve previously given to. Any gifts should be 'reasonable' and take into account how much money you have.

You can't authorise attorneys to go beyond these limits. Here are types of gifts you can't authorise:

* gifts intended to reduce inheritance tax liability
* trust funds for grandchildren
* payment of school fees for grandchildren
* interest-free loans to family
* maintenance for any family member other than your wife, husband, civil partner or child under 18

Your attorneys must apply to the Court of Protection if they want to make gifts like this on your behalf.

### Other mistakes
You should avoid these common mistakes:

* You can't tell your attorneys to do anything against the law – this includes anything to do with euthanasia and assisted suicide.
* You can't say that attorneys should act in the best interests of your wife, husband, partner or children. Your attorneys act for you, not anyone else.
* You can't say a replacement attorney can only start acting in specific circumstances – see [Replacement attorneys](/help/#topic-replacement-attorneys) for more information. For instance, you can't use instructions to add special circumstances – such as an original attorney being on holiday – in which your replacement attorney can step in.
* Don’t add health and welfare instructions to a property and financial affairs LPA. Don't add property and financial instructions to a health and welfare LPA. You should make a separate LPA for each instead.
* You can't tell an attorney to change your will – it's outside their powers.
* You can't give an attorney power to appoint a replacement attorney.
