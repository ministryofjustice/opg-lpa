## Before you begin

Before you start making the LPA, it’s important that the [donor](/help/#topic-donor) knows how they want it to work and talks to the people they want to be involved.

The donor should decide:

* who they want as their [attorneys](/help/#topic-attorneys)
* whether they want any [replacement attorneys](/help/#topic-replacement-attorneys) and when the replacements should step in
* how they want their attorneys to [make decisions together](/help/#topic-how-multiple-attorneys-make-decisions)
* if they want to give any [instructions or preferences](/help/#topic-preferences-and-instructions) to guide their attorneys’ decisions
* who will be their [certificate provider](/help/#topic-certificate-providers)
* whether anyone should be [notified about the LPA](/help/#topic-people-to-notify)

Remember that you will need to print the LPA and that everyone named in the LPA, apart from the people to notify, will need to [sign the LPA in the right order](/help/#topic-signing-the-lpa).

### Information you’ll need to make an LPA

We’ll save the LPA as you progress so you do not need to complete it in one go. You can sign out at any time and come back later.

You may find it useful to gather some information before you start.

You’ll need the names, addresses and dates of birth of:

* the donor 
* all attorneys
* the replacement attorneys, if the donor decides to have any

You’ll also need the names and addresses of:

* the certificate provider
* the people to notify, if the donor decides to have any
