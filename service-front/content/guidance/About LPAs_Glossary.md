## Glossary

Here are some words you'll see when you're making your lasting power of attorney (LPA). The help topics explain many of them in more detail.

**Advanced decision**

An advance decision is a legally binding document in which you state which life-sustaining treatments you do not want, in case you cannot decide at some point.

**Applicant**

The applicant is the person who applies to register the LPA – that can be the donor or one or more of their attorneys.

**Attorney**

Attorneys are people the donor appoints in their LPA to make decisions on their behalf. Attorneys should be people the donor knows well and trusts.

Attorneys do not need to be lawyers. Many people choose their wife, husband, civil partner, partner, children, other relatives or close friends. Attorneys must be at least 18 years old.

**Certificate provider**

Certificate providers are impartial people who confirm that the donor understands what they are doing and that nobody is forcing them to make the LPA. An LPA must have a certificate provider.

**Correspondent**

The correspondent is the person that OPG will send the LPA to once it has been registered. OPG will also contact the correspondent if we have questions about the LPA.

The correspondent can be the donor, one of their attorneys, or someone else, such as a solicitor.

**Donor**

The donor is the person making the LPA and choosing other people to make decisions on their behalf. Only the donor can make decisions about their LPA, such as choosing their attorneys. A donor must be at least 18 years old and have mental capacity when they make their LPA.

**Exemption**

If the donor gets certain means-tested benefits, they can apply not to pay the fee to register their LPA. This is known as an 'exemption'. Also see 'Remission'.

**Instructions**

The donor can give instructions in their LPA. These tell the attorneys things that they must and must not do when making decisions and acting for the donor. Many donors do not add instructions, as they trust their attorneys to make the decisions. Also see 'Preferences'.

**Jointly**

When a donor chooses to appoint their attorneys 'jointly', it means the attorneys must unanimously agree on every decision they make for the donor. If the attorneys cannot all agree on a decision, they cannot make it. If one attorney dies or can no longer act on the donor’s behalf, the others will not be able to make any decisions and the LPA will stop working, unless the donor has stated otherwise.

**Jointly and severally**

When a donor chooses to appoint their attorneys 'jointly and severally', it means that attorneys can make decisions together or separately.

This is the most practical option as decisions will not be delayed, or not made, because attorneys cannot meet or agree.

**Jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for other decisions**

When a donor chooses to appoint their attorneys 'jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for other decisions', it means that the attorneys must unanimously agree on some specific decisions but can make other decisions together or separately.

Donors who pick this option must clearly state all the decisions that must be agreed unanimously. If one attorney dies or can no longer act on the donor’s behalf, the others will not be able to make the joint decisions unless the donor has stated otherwise. They can continue to make other decisions.

**Lasting power of attorney (LPA)**

An LPA is a legal document that allows the donor to choose other people to make decisions on their behalf. There are 2 types of LPA:

* health and welfare LPA, which can only be used if the donor does not have mental capacity
* property and financial affairs LPA, which can be used as soon as it's registered, if the donor decides they need people to help them, and if they do not have mental capacity

An LPA must be registered by the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) before it can be used.

**Life-sustaining treatment**

Life-sustaining treatment is any care, medicine, surgery or other remedy that a doctor says is needed to keep the donor alive.

If the donor makes a health and welfare LPA, they must decide whether to give their attorneys or doctors the power to allow or refuse life-sustaining treatment on their behalf. Decisions on life-sustaining treatment can only be made by others if the donor does not have mental capacity.

**Mental capacity**

Mental capacity means the ability to make a decision. A person with mental capacity has at least a general understanding of the decision they need to make, why they need to make it and what is likely to happen when they make it. Sometimes people have the capacity to make some decisions but not others.

**Office of the Public Guardian (OPG)**

OPG is the agency in England and Wales that registers LPAs and protects people who do not have mental capacity.

**People to notify**

The donor can choose people to be told when the applicant applies to register the LPA. We call these 'people to notify'. Having people to notify is optional.

People to notify provide extra security as they get a chance to raise any concerns about the LPA before it's registered – for example, if they believe the donor has been put under pressure to make it.

**Preferences**

The donor can state preferences in their LPA. Preferences are things the donor would like their attorneys to think about when making decisions on the donor’s behalf. Attorneys should take the donor’s preferences into account but do not have to follow them. Also see 'Instructions'.

**Registration**

Once the LPA has been made and signed, the applicant should post  it to OPG for registration. We’ll check that the LPA has been made correctly and there's nothing that would make it invalid or unworkable.

An LPA must be registered with OPG before it can be used.

**Remission**

If the donor has an income of less than £12,000 a year before tax, they can apply to pay less to apply to register their LPA. This is known as a 'remission'. Also see 'Exemption'.

**Replacement attorneys**

Replacement attorneys are people the donor chooses to step in if one or more of their attorneys can no longer act or make decisions.

**Trust corporation**

A trust corporation can be an attorney on a property and financial affairs LPA. A trust corporation manages the donor’s funds, including savings, pensions or investments. A trust corporation is usually run by a commercial bank or firm of solicitors. The donor cannot appoint more than one trust corporation in their LPA.

**Witness**

Witnesses are impartial people who watch the donor, attorneys and any replacement attorneys sign the LPA. The witnesses must also sign the LPA to say they've seen the donor and attorneys sign.
