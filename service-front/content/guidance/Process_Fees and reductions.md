# Fees, reductions and exemptions

It costs £82 to apply to register an LPA. If you (the donor) have a low income or get certain means-tested benefits, you can pay a lower fee or no fee.

1. If you receive particular means-tested benefits, you won't have to pay anything (this is called an 'exemption').

2. If you have an income before tax of less than £12,000 a year, you will only have to pay half (this is known as a '50 per cent remission').

3. If you get Universal Credit, you may also be entitled to a remission. The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) will work out how much you should pay when it receives your application.

If an attorney applies to register the LPA, the attorney's financial circumstances aren't taken into account. The attorney can pay the fee and reclaim it from the donor's funds.

It is only the donor whose benefits and income matter.

### LPA fee changes

The LPA application fee was reduced on 01 April 2017. If you have already printed and signed your LPA and are paying by cheque, then please send the relevant reduced fee. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/opg">GOV.UK/opg</a> for more information.

## Means-tested benefits: no fee

If you (the donor) get any of these means-tested benefits, you won't have to pay a fee:

* Income Support
* Income-based Employment and Support Allowance
* Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance
* Guarantee Credit element of State Pension Credit
* a combination of Working Tax Credit and at least one of:
	* Child Tax Credit
	* Disability Element of Working Tax Credit
	* Severe Disability Element of Working Tax Credit
* Housing Benefit
* Council Tax Reduction (not the 25% single person reduction or the Class U exemption) or Council Tax Support
* Local Housing Allowance.

If you have been awarded personal injury damages of more than £16,000, you can't get an exemption, even if the damages were ignored when you were assessed for a benefit.

Disability Living Allowance, Invalidity Benefit and Personal Independence Payment don't allow you to get an exemption from paying the fee.

### Proof of benefits

You have to prove that you (the donor) get one of the relevant benefits. Your proof should be a recent letter from:

* the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)
or
* another relevant benefit provider confirming that you receive benefits.

The letter must confirm that you got the benefit at the time the LPA was sent to OPG for registration. The letter should include these details:

* title
* full name
* address including postcode

Send your proof to the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) with all the following:

* LPA document
* application for remission form (LPA120A)

## Low income: reduced fee

If you have a gross annual income of less than £12,000 you will be eligible to pay only half of the fee (this is called a 'remission').

Gross annual income is income before tax. It's not just salary or wages – it may come from different sources, such as:

* non-means-tested benefits (for example, Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance)
* pensions
* interest from capital investments
* rental income from property

### Proof of low income

You have to send OPG documents that prove you have a low income. These must be documents that have your title, full name, address and postcode printed on them and they must be from the current tax year. (Tax years run from 6 April one year to 5 April the next year.) Proof can include photocopies of:

* 3 months' consecutive wage slips or a P60
* statements from a pension provider
* a recent tax return if you're self-employed
* statements or vouchers showing interest from capital, stocks, shares or bonds

You can also send an official letter or notice from the payer of non-means-tested benefits.

If you don't have an income, you have to send OPG a signed statement explaining how you support yourself.

Send your proof to OPG with all the following:

* LPA document
* application for remission form (LPA120A)

## Universal Credit: reduced fee

If you receive Universal Credit, you may also be able to pay less.

Because Universal Credit is being tested and replaces several existing benefits, OPG will have to look at your application before it can say how much of the fee you'll have to pay.

If you state that you get Universal Credit, you won't be charged through this digital service to make your application. This service will still create all the documents you need, but you won't be asked to pay.

### Proof of Universal Credit

Send a copy of your benefit award letter to OPG with all the following:

* LPA document
* application for remission form (LPA120A)

OPG will contact you to let you know how much you'll have to pay and to arrange payment. OPG aims to do this within 7 working days of getting your application.
