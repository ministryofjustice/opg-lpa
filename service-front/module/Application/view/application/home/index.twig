        <span class="summary">How much does it cost to apply to register an LPA?</span>
    </summary>

    <p>There's a &pound;110 application fee to register an LPA, paid by or on behalf of the donor – that’s the person who’s making the LPA. If the donor has an income below £12,000, or gets certain benefits, they might qualify for a lower fee, or the fee might be waived altogether.</p>
    <p><a class="js-guidance" href="/guidance/#topic-fees-and-reductions" data-journey-click="stageprompt.lpa:help:fees-and-reductions">Fees and reductions</a></p>
    <p>Remember, an LPA must be registered before it can be used.</p>

        <span class="summary">How long does it take to register an LPA?</span>
    </summary>

    <p>After you send in your application, it can be 8 to 10 weeks before you receive the registered LPA.</p>
    <p>Some of this is processing time, when we check that there are no mistakes in the LPA, including anything that would make it invalid or unworkable. We'll get in touch if there are problems.</p>
    <p>The time also includes a four-week waiting period. This is a safeguard required by law and allows people involved in the LPA to raise any concerns they might have.</p>
    <p>It’s a good idea to apply to register an LPA sooner rather than later.</p>

    <p>Not quite. This digital tool will help you make an LPA and support you in applying to register it. You’ll need to print a copy though, and get this signed, as well as completing some of the registration tasks offline. Then you’ll need to post the LPA to OPG for registration.</p>
    <p>We’ll explain what you need to do as you complete each step.</p>
    <p>You need a PDF reader like Adobe Reader (<a href='http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/reader.html' target='_blank'>http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/reader.html</a>) to view and print the LPA forms.</p>
