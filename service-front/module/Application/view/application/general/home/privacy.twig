	<h2 class="heading-medium">Who manages the Make a lasting power of attorney service</h2>

	<p>This service is managed by OPG, which is an executive agency sponsored by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ).</p>

	<p>MoJ is the data controller for the personal data we store. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-public-guardian/about/personal-information-charter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OPG’s personal information charter<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> explains how we process personal data.</p>

	<p>You can find more information about using the 'Make a lasting power of attorney' service in the <a href="/terms" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">terms of use<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> and our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/help/cookies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cookies policy<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.</p>


	<h2 class="heading-medium">Why we collect personal data and how we use it</h2>

	<p>In order to use this service, you need to enter personal information about the donor and the people they want to be involved in their LPA. For example: names, contact details and dates of birth.</p>

	<p>We use the information you provide to populate your LPA application, and for no other purpose.</p>

	<p>You can find out more about how we use the data once you have posted the LPA to us in the lasting power of attorney privacy notice.</p>


	<h2 class="heading-medium">The personal data we collect</h2>

	<p>We only collect the personal data that is relevant for the services we are providing to you.</p>

	<p>The personal data we collect includes:</p>

	<ul class="list list-bullet">
		<li>the name, address, email address and date of birth of the donor, attorneys and replacement attorneys</li>
		<li>the name and address of the correspondent, the certificate provider and any people to notify</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If the donor is applying to pay a reduced or no fee, we will also ask for:</p>

	<ul class="list list-bullet">
		<li>evidence that the donor receives certain benefits</li>
		<li>evidence of the donor’s income</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This service also contains several free-text fields. You should not enter sensitive information into these free-text fields unless absolutely necessary for your application. Sensitive information may include, but is not limited to, details of religious beliefs and financial information.</p>

	<h3 class="heading-small">Legal basis for processing this data</h3>

	<p>By registering for and using this service, you consent to us using the data you enter to help you make an LPA application that you can print, sign, and post to the OPG.</p>

	<p>Your use of this online service is optional. If you prefer, you can make an LPA using a paper or PDF form. If you post an LPA application to us, it will be processed in line with OPG's <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/732473/opg20-privacy-notice-lpa-and-epa.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lasting power of attorney privacy notice<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.</p>

	<h3 class="heading-small">Cookies and site usage data</h3>

	<p>OPG and the Government Digital Service collects site usage information from this service. This allows us to see how the service is being used so we can improve it. This information does not contain any personal data and is stored separately from the information you enter when using this service.</p>

	<p>Find out more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/help/cookies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cookies<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.</p>


	<h2 class="heading-medium">How we store data</h2>

	<p>Information you enter into the service is stored in a secure database within the European Economic Area (EEA). However, due to the global nature of the internet, the data sent to and from the database may transit through countries outside of the EEA. Data is not stored in a non-EEA country.</p>

	<p>It may sometimes be necessary to transfer personal information overseas. Any transfers made will fully comply with all aspects of data protection law. For example, data is encrypted during transfer.</p>

	<h3 class="heading-small">Who has access to data in the service</h3>

	<p>Our hosting provider (Amazon Web Services) and MoJ staff are responsible for supporting the service and have access to the secure database.</p>

	<p>All staff who have access to the database have MoJ security clearance.</p>

	<p>Information you enter into the service is not sent to OPG, but is stored in a secure database. OPG will only see the information when we receive the paper LPA application you post to us. You can find out more about how we store and use this data in OPG’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-public-guardian/about/personal-information-charter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">personal information charter<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> and <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/732473/opg20-privacy-notice-lpa-and-epa.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lasting power of attorney privacy notice<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.</p>

	<p>We do not use personal data when testing the service.</p>

	<h3 class="heading-small">How long we keep data</h3>

	<p>Information you enter into the online service is kept for 9 months from the date you last used your account. This allows enough time for most users to complete their LPA application and for OPG to process it, along with some contingency time.</p>

	<p>We’ll email you before the 9 months is up to ask whether you would like to keep or delete your account.</p>

	<p>We will keep your personal data in line with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/record-retention-and-disposition-schedules" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OPG’s data retention policy<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.</p>

	<h3 class="heading-small">Change or delete information you’ve provided</h3>

	<p>Before you click to confirm your LPA application is complete, you can change or delete the information you’ve provided.  Once you’ve confirmed your LPA is complete, you cannot make any further changes to it, but you can delete it.</p>

	<p>You can also delete your own account, and all information in it, by signing in to the service, going to the ‘Your details’ page and selecting ‘Delete account’.</p>

	<p>If you delete your account or a particular LPA after you have posted a paper LPA application to us, OPG will still hold the information in that paper application. Visit OPG’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/732473/opg20-privacy-notice-lpa-and-epa.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lasting power of attorney privacy notice<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> to find out when and how you can request that we delete this information.</p>


	<h2 class="heading-medium">Sharing personal data</h2>

	<p>We will only share the information you give us when the law says we can. For example, we may share information with the police to help them prevent or investigate crime. </p>

		<li>share your information with other organisations for marketing, market research or commercial purposes</li>
		<li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>

	<p>Neither Notify nor its SMS, email and post providers will use your personal information for direct marketing. <a href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/features/security" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Find out more about security and data protection on Notify<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.</p>
