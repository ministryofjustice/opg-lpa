<div class="text">
	<p>The Make a lasting power of attorney (LPA) service helps you make an LPA application. You'll be asked some questions and we'll use your answers to create an LPA that you can save and print, sign and then send to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-public-guardian" target="_blank">Office of the Public Guardian</a> (OPG) for registration.</p>

	<p>The service is intended for use by a donor (the person the LPA is for), or by others on their behalf and with their consent.</p>

	<p>By using this online service, you agree to:</p>

	<ul class="list list-bullet">
		<li>keep to these terms of use, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/help/terms-conditions" target="_blank">GOV.UK terms and conditions</a>, and the standards set out in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-public-guardian/about/personal-information-charter" target="_blank">personal information charter</a></li>
		<li>follow the rules that apply to the creation and registration of an LPA. You can find these in the <a class="js-guidance" href="/guide#topic-how-to-make-an-lpa-online" data-journey-click="page:link:help: help section" target="_blank">help section</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Any information you provide will be stored securely and used inline with our <a href="/privacy-notice" target="_blank">privacy notice</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/help/cookies" target="_blank">cookies policy</a>.</p>

	<h3 class="heading-small">Information provided by this service</h3>

	<p>OPG provides information and guidance to support you in making and applying to register LPAs. However, this guidance shouldn’t be considered legal advice and we can’t give legal advice on individual cases. </p>

	<p>When you answer questions within this service, consider the specific circumstances of the donor (the person the LPA is for), and get advice from a legal professional if needed.</p>


	<h2 class="heading-medium">Your account security</h2>

	<p>When you create an LPA online account, use a valid email address and choose a strong password that someone else won’t be able to guess easily.</p>

	<p>It’s your responsibility to keep your sign-in details safe. Don’t share your password with anyone or write it down.</p>

	<p>You are responsible for all activity on your Make a lasting power of attorney service account.</p>

	<p>We recommend that you sign out of your account when you’re not using the service. We’ll automatically sign you out if you haven’t used the service for an hour.</p>

	<h3 class="heading-small">Accessing the service securely</h3>

	<p>You’re responsible for accessing the service securely. You shouldn’t access it using a computer or network that may leave personal information accessible to others. For example, there are risks in leaving a computer unprotected while you’re signed in to the service, or in using a shared computer or open WiFi network to access the service.</p>


	<h2 class="heading-medium">Online payment</h2>

	<p>When you pay your application fee online, you’re paying for your application to register an LPA to be processed by OPG.</p>

	<p>If you choose to pay online, you’ll be directed to our payment partner, GOV.UK Pay, for the payment to be processed.</p>

	<p>The details you give them will be encrypted in line with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). OPG won’t store your payment card details.</p>

	<p>OPG isn’t liable for any information you enter into GOV.UK Pay’s pages, or for the availability of the GOV.UK Pay site.</p>

	<p>To pay online you must abide by GOV.UK Pay’s <a href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/privacy/" target="_blank">terms and conditions and privacy notice</a>.</p>

	<p>If you pay online and change your mind about registering the LPA before you post it to OPG, we will refund the money to your payment card.</p>

	<p>If you paid online, the fee will be returned to you if OPG haven’t received your signed LPA within 40 days of payment. You can still send the LPA to OPG after this time, but if you’ve already been refunded we’ll contact you to arrange a new payment.</p>
