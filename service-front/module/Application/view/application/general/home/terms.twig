	<p>The Make a lasting power of attorney (LPA) service helps you make an LPA application. You'll be asked some questions and we'll use your answers to create an LPA that you can save, print, sign and then send to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-public-guardian" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Office of the Public Guardian (OPG)<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> for registration.</p>

	<p>The service is intended for use by the donor (the person the LPA is for), or by others on the donor’s behalf and with their consent.</p>

	<p>By using this online service, you agree to:</p>

	<h2 class="heading-medium">Information provided by this service</h2>

	<p>OPG provides information and guidance to support you in making and applying to register an LPA. However, this guidance should not be considered legal advice and we cannot give legal advice on individual cases.</p>

	<p>When you answer questions within this service, consider the specific circumstances of the donor (the person the LPA is for), and get advice from a legal professional if needed.</p>


	<h2 class="heading-medium">Your account security</h2>

	<p>When you create an online account for this service, use a valid email address and choose a strong password that someone else will not be able to guess easily.</p>

	<p>It’s your responsibility to keep your sign-in details safe. Do not share your password with anyone or write it down.</p>

	<p>You are responsible for all activity on your Make a lasting power of attorney service account.</p>

	<p>We recommend that you sign out of your account when you’re not using the service. We’ll automatically sign you out if you have not used the service for an hour.</p>

	<h3 class="heading-small">Accessing the service securely</h3>

	<p>You’re responsible for accessing the service securely. You should not access it using a computer or network that may leave personal information accessible to others. For example, you should not:</p>

		<li>leave a computer unprotected while you’re signed in to the service</li>
		<li>access the service using a shared or public computer</li>
		<li>access the service using an open WiFi network</li>
	</ul>


	<h2 class="heading-medium">Online payment</h2>

	<p>When you pay your application fee online, you’re paying for your application to register an LPA to be processed by OPG.</p>

	<p>If you choose to pay online, you’ll be directed to our payment partner, GOV.UK Pay, for the payment to be processed.</p>

	<p>The details you give them will be encrypted in line with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). OPG will not store your payment card details.</p>

	<p>OPG is not liable for any information you enter into GOV.UK Pay’s pages, or for the availability of the GOV.UK Pay site.</p>

	<p>To pay online you must abide by GOV.UK Pay’s <a href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/privacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">terms and conditions and privacy notice<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.</p>

	<p>If you pay online but then change your mind about registering the LPA before you post it to OPG, we will refund the money to your payment card.</p>

	<p>If you paid online, the fee will be returned to you if OPG have not received your signed LPA within 40 days of payment. You can still send the LPA to OPG after this time, but if you’ve already been refunded we’ll contact you to arrange a new payment.</p>
