            It is free to complete your LPA online, however your LPA cannot be used until it's registered. There's a &pound;{{ lpaFee }} application fee to register each LPA. If the donor has an income below £12,000, or gets certain benefits, they might qualify for a lower fee, or the fee might be waived altogether. If you're eligible for a reduction the completed form for this will be given to you at the end of this service. You can pay your application fee by card online or send a cheque with your LPA to OPG.

            For an LPA to be valid it needs to be signed and witnessed by all people mentioned on the
            LPA. The online tool makes it simpler to do the first part, the filling in of the form.
            You can take your time and can read extra help if you need it. A printed, signed LPA has to
            be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian before it can be used.
