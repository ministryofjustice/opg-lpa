<p>That’s all we need for the LPA itself. Now it’s ready to print and sign.</p>

<p>After it’s signed, you’ll need to log back in here to complete a registration form and pay the application fee.</p>

<p>Everything’s been saved, so you can pause here to arrange things and talk to
the people involved in your LPA. We've emailed you a link that you can follow
whenever you’re ready to register, or just sign back in to this account.</p>

    <h3>Print your LPA</h3>
    <div class="form-download">
      <p><a class="pdf_dl_lnk" href="<?= $this->downloadRoute ?>" target="_blank">Download the LPA document you've created now</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>Most computers will open this LPA document automatically when you click on the link above.</p>
    <p>If the LPA document doesn't open automatically, you may need a PDF reader like Adobe Reader (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/reader.html" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/reader.html</a>) to view and print the LPA forms.</p>
    <p>You can print in colour or black and white.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Sign your LPA</h3>
    <p>Everyone involved must sign the LPA. Follow the instructions on the cover sheet of your LPA document. <a class="js-guidance" href="/help/#topic-signing-the-lpa" data-journey-click="stageprompt.lpa:help:signing-the-lpa">Find out more about who needs to sign the LPA – and in what order</a>.</p>

    <p>Please don’t make any changes to your LPA after it’s been signed. If you do
      need to change it, come back and edit it here, then print and sign the new version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Register the LPA</h3>
    <p>After everyone’s signed the LPA, you have to pay an application fee, then send the signed LPA along with a completed registration form to the Office of the Public Guardian. It’s a good idea to apply to register your LPA straight after making it. An unregistered LPA can't be used.</p>
