MESSAGE:

# Request to reset password

You do not have an account associated with this email address, so you cannot reset your password.

You can create an account now at:
((signUpUrl))

If the link does not work, copy it into your browser's address bar.

If you think that you already have an LPA account, please check that:

* you tried to log in using the right email address.
* your account has not been deleted. For security, we automatically delete accounts that have not been used for 9 months. We will have sent you an email before we did this - please check your inbox.
