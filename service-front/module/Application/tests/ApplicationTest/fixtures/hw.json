I break down the wall.\"\n\nKaa looked carefully till he found a discolored crack in the marble tracery showing a weak spot, made two or three light taps with his head to get the distance, and then lifting up six feet of his body clear of the ground, sent home half a dozen full-power smashing blows, nose-first. The screen-work broke and fell away in a cloud of dust and rubbish, and Mowgli leaped through the opening and flung himself between Baloo and Bagheera--an arm around each big neck.\n\n\"Art thou hurt?\" said Baloo, hugging him softly.\n\n\"I am sore, hungry, and not a little bruised. But, oh, they have handled ye grievously, my Brothers! Ye bleed.\"\n\n\"Others also,\" said Bagheera, licking his lips and looking at the monkey-dead on the terrace and round the tank.\n\n\"It is nothing, it is nothing, if thou art safe, oh, my pride of all little frogs!\" whimpered Baloo.\n\n\"Of that we shall judge later,\" said Bagheera, in a dry voice that Mowgli did not at all like. \"But here is Kaa to whom we owe the battle and thou owest thy life. Thank him according to our customs, Mowgli.\"\n\nMowgli turned and saw the great Python's head swaying a foot above his own.\n\n\"So this is the manling,\" said Kaa. \"Very soft is his skin, and he is not unlike the Bandar-log. Have a care, manling, that I do not mistake thee for a monkey some twilight when I have newly changed my coat.\"\n\n\"We be one blood, thou and I,\" Mowgli answered. \"I take my life from thee tonight. My kill shall be thy kill if ever thou art hungry, O Kaa.\"\n\n\"All thanks, Little Brother,\" said Kaa, though his eyes twinkled. \"And what may so bold a hunter kill? I ask that I may follow when next he goes abroad.\"\n\n\"I kill nothing,--I am too little,--but I drive goats toward such as can use them. When thou art empty come to me and see if I speak the truth. I have some skill in these [he held out his hands], and if ever thou art in a trap, I may pay the debt which I owe to thee, to Bagheera, and to Baloo, here. Good hunting to ye all, my masters.\"\n\n\"Well said,\" growled Baloo, for Mowgli had returned thanks very prettily. The Python dropped his head lightly for a minute on Mowgli's shoulder. \"A brave heart and a courteous tongue,\" said he. \"They shall carry thee far through the jungle,",
        "preference": "\"They have no leader,\" said Bagheera. \"They lie. They have always lied.\"\n\n\"They were very kind and bade me come again. Why have I never been taken among the Monkey People? They stand on their feet as I do. They do not hit me with their hard paws. They play all day. Let me get up! Bad Baloo, let me up! I will play w",

            "howDetails": "\"By whom?\" said Mowgli. \"Are we all jackals, to fawn on this cattle butcher? The leadership of the Pack is with the Pack alone.\"\n\nThere were yells of \"Silence, thou man's cub!\" \"Let him speak. He has kept our Law\"; and at last the seniors of the Pack thundered: \"Let the Dead Wolf speak.\" When a leader of the Pack has missed his kill, he is called the Dead Wolf as long as he lives, which is not long.\n\nAkela raised his old head wearily:--\n\n\"Free People, and ye too, jackals of Shere Khan, for twelve seasons I have led ye to and from the kill, and in all that time not one has been trapped or maimed. Now I have missed my kill. Ye know how that plot was made. Ye know how ye brought me up to an untried buck to make my weakness known. It was cleverly done. Your right is to kill me here on the Council Rock, now. Therefore, I ask, who comes to make an end of the Lone Wolf? For it is my right, by the Law of the Jungle, that ye come one by one.\"\n\nThere was a long hush, for no single wolf cared to fight Akela to the death. Then Shere Khan roared: \"Bah! What have we to do with this toothless fool? He is doomed to die! It is the man-cub who has lived too long. Free People, he was my meat from the first. Give him to me. I am weary of this man-wolf folly. He has troubled the jungle for ten seasons. Give me the man-cub, or I will hunt here always, and not give you one bone. He is a man, a man's child, and from the marrow of my bones I hate him!\"\n\nThen more than half the Pack yelled: \"A man! A man! What has a man to do with us? Let him go to his own place.\"\n\n\"And turn all the people of the villages against us?\" clamored Shere Khan. \"No, give him to me. He is a man, and none of us can look him between the eyes.\"\n\nAkela lifted his head again and said, \"He has eaten our food. He has slept with us. He has driven game for us. He has broken no word of the Law of the Jungle.\"\n\n\"Also, I paid for him with a bull when he was accepted. The worth of a bull is little, but Bagheera's honor is something that he will perhaps fight for,\" said Bagheera in his gentlest voice.\n\n\"A bull paid ten years ago!\" the Pack snarled. \"What do we care for bones ten years old?\"\n\n\"Or for a pledge?\" said Bagheera, his white teeth bared under his lip. \"Well are ye called the Free People!\"\n\n\"No man's cub can run with the people of the jungle,\" howled Shere Khan. \"Give him to me!\"\n\n\"He is our brother in all but blood,\" Akela went on, \"and ye would kill him here! In truth, I have lived too long. Some of ye are eaters of cattle, and of others I have heard that, under Shere Khan's teaching, ye go by dark night and snatch children from the villager's doorstep. Therefore I know ye to be cowards, and it is to cowards I speak. It is certain that I must die, and my life is of no worth, or I would offer that in the man-cub's place.
