# Terraform Account

This terraform configuration manages per-account or otherwise shared resources.

Per-environment resources are managed in ../terraform_environment

## Running Terraform Locally

This repository comes with an `.envrc` file containing useful environment variables for working with this repository.

`.envrc` can be sourced automatically using either [direnv](https://direnv.net) or manually with bash.

```bash
source .envrc
```

```bash
direnv allow
```

This sets environment variables that allow the following commands with no further setup needed.

```bash
aws-vault exec identity -- terraform init
aws-vault exec identity -- terraform plan
aws-vault exec identity -- terraform force-unlock 49b3784c-51eb-668d-ac4b-3bd5b8701925
```


## Fixing state lock issue
A Terraform state lock error can happen if a terraform job is forcefully terminated (normal ctrl+c gracefully releases state lock).

CircleCI terminates a process if you cancel a job, so state lock doesn't get released.

Here's how to fix it if it happens.
Error: 

```hsl
rror locking state: Error acquiring the state lock: ConditionalCheckFailedException: The conditional request failed
    status code: 400, request id: 60Q304F4TMIRB13AMS36M49ND7VV4KQNSO5AEMVJF66Q9ASUAAJG

Fix:
```hsl
aws-vault exec identity -- terraform init
aws-vault exec identity -- terraform workspace select development
aws-vault exec identity -- terraform force-unlock 69592de7-6132-c863-ae53-976776ffe6cf
```

It is important to select the correct workspace. 
For terraform_shared, this will map to the AWS account, development, preproduction or production.
