Feature: Create a Health and Welfare LPA

    I want to create a Health and Welfare LPA

    # background steps logs us in and takes us to the type page
    Background:
        Given I ignore application exceptions
        When I log in as appropriate test user
        And If I am on dashboard I click to create lpa

        Then I see in the page text
            | There is a problem |
            | Choose a type of LPA |
        When I choose Health and Welfare
        And I click "save"
        Then I am taken to the donor page
        And I see "This LPA covers health and welfare" in the page text
        # save button should be missing initially

        # casper simply checked for 8 options so we do too, but we may ultimately wish to check the values
        And I can find "name-title" with 8 options
        When I type "B1 1TF" into "postcode-lookup" working around cypress bug
        # cypress is not reliable at filling in postcode fully before hitting next button, so, ensure it is now filled in
        And I see "postcode-lookup" prepopulated within timeout with "B1 1TF"
        And I click element marked "Find UK address"
