Feature: Create a Property and Finance LPA

    I want to create a Property and Finance LPA

    Background:
        Given I ignore application exceptions
        And I create PF LPA test fixture

    @focus, @CleanupFixtures
    Scenario: Create LPA normal path
        When I log in as appropriate test user
        And I visit the donor page for the in-progress lpa
        Then I see "This LPA covers property and financial affairs" in the page text
        # save button should be missing initially
        And I cannot find "save-and-continue"
        When I click "add-donor"
        Then I can see popup
        # todo - casper merely checked for existence of use-my-details. We need ultimately to actually test this
        And I can find "use-my-details"
        When I type "B1 1TF" into "postcode-lookup" working around cypress bug
        # cypress is not reliable at filling in postcode fully before hitting next button, so, ensure it is now filled in
        And I see "postcode-lookup" prepopulated within timeout with "B1 1TF"
        And I click element marked "Find UK address"
        # casper simply checked for 6 options so we do too, but we may ultimately wish to check the values
        Then I can find old style id "#address-search-result" with 6 options
        # casper simply checked for 8 options so we do too, but we may ultimately wish to check the values
        And I can find "name-title" with 8 options
        When I force fill out
