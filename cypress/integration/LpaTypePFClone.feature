Feature: Clone Property and Finance LPA starting from the Type page

    I want to go to the type page and clone a Property and Finance LPA

    Background:
        Given I ignore application exceptions
        And I set cloned to true
        And I log in as second seeded user
        Then I am taken to the dashboard page

    @focus, @CleanupFixtures
    Scenario: Choose Property and Finance as Lpa Type
        # we should find at least one existing lpa with related links. we simply click the first one we find , to clone it
        Then I can find "check-signing-dates"
        And I can find "delete-lpa"
        When I click occurrence 0 of "reuse-lpa-details"
        Then I am taken to the type page for cloned lpa
        When I choose Property and Finance
        And I click "save"
        Then I am taken to the donor page
        And I see "This LPA covers property and financial affairs" in the page text
