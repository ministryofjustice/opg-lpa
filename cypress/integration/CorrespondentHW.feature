    @focus @CleanupFixtures
    Scenario: Add a correspondent 
        When I log in as appropriate test user
        And I visit the correspondent page for the test fixture lpa
        Then I am taken to the correspondent page

        And I can find "contactInWelsh-0"
        And I can find "contactInWelsh-1"
        And I can find "contactByPhone"
        And I can find "contactByPost"
        And I can find hidden "phone-number"
        And I can find hidden "email-address"
        And I can find "change-correspondent" with data-inited
        When I click "change-correspondent"
        Then I can find "form-reuse-details"
        And I see "Which details would you like to reuse?" in the page text
        # donor is correspondent as default
        And I see "Mrs Nancy Garrison" in the page text
        And "contactByEmail" is checked
        # choose donor as correspondent
        When I check "reuse-details-1"
        And I click "continue"
        # next line is essential, cypress needs the form not to be there before it can reliably find save button in CI
        Then I cannot find "form-reuse-details" 
        And I see "Mrs Nancy Garrison" in the page text
        And I click "save"
        Then I am taken to the who are you page
