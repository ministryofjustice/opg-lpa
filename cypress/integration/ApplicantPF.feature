        And I visit the applicant page for the test fixture lpa
        # ** CUT Above Here ** This comment line needed for stitching feature files. Please do not remove

        Then I am taken to the applicant page
        When I click "save"
        Then I see in the page text
            | There is a problem |
            | Select the person who is applying to register the LPA |
        And I see "Error" in the title
        # select the donor as applicant
        When I check occurrence 0 of checkbox
        And I click "save"
        Then I am taken to the correspondent page
