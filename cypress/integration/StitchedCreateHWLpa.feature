Feature: Health and Welfare LPA starting from the Type page

    I want to go to the type page and create a Health and Welfare LPA

    Background:
        Given I ignore application exceptions
        And I log in as appropriate test user
        And If I am on dashboard I visit the type page

    @focus @CleanupFixtures
    Scenario: Create LPA with error first
        When I click "save"
        Then I see in the page text
            | There is a problem |
            | Choose a type of LPA |
        And I see "Error" in the title
        When I choose Health and Welfare
        And I click "save"
        Then I am taken to the donor page
        And I see "This LPA covers health and welfare" in the page text
        When I click "add-donor"

        # casper simply checked for 8 options so we do too, but we may ultimately wish to check the values
        And I can find "name-title" with 8 options
        When I type "B1 1TF" into "postcode-lookup" working around cypress bug
        # cypress is not reliable at filling in postcode fully before hitting next button, so, ensure it is now filled in
        And I see "postcode-lookup" prepopulated within timeout with "B1 1TF"
        And I click element marked "Find UK address"
