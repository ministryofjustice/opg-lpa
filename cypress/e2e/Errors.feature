Feature: Errors

    I want to see useful and relevant error messages

    Background:
        Given I ignore application exceptions

    Scenario: Error message heading level and text / server-rendered (LPAL-247)
        Given I visit "/send-feedback"
        When I submit the feedback
        Then I see "There is a problem" in the page text
        And I see "Error" in the title
        And "error-heading" is a "level 2 heading" element
        And there is "one" "level 1 heading" element on the page

    # requires additional scenarios as login page doesn't use the error macro;
    # this path attempts to log the user in and fails, but doesn't use
    # the same path through the code as invalid form fields (see below);
    # a failed login (but valid email input) produces a different type of error
    # from invalid form fields
    @RunErrorSummaryCheckAfterStep
    Scenario: Error message heading level and text / server-rendered auth - valid email (LPAL-247)
        Given I visit "/login"
        And I type "foo@example.com" into "login-email"
        And I type "aaa" into "login-password"
        And I click "login-submit-button"
        Then I see "There is a problem" in the page text
        And I see "Error" in the title
        And "error-heading" is a "level 2 heading" element
        And there is "one" "level 1 heading" element on the page

    @RunErrorSummaryCheckAfterStep
    Scenario: Fail to select type of LPA to create, error links to first radio (LPAL-248, LPAL-254)
        When I log in as appropriate test user
        And If I am on dashboard I click to create lpa
        And I click "save"
        Then I see in the page text
            | There is a problem |
            | Choose a type of LPA |
        And I see "Error" in the title

        # LPAL-254: error summary should get focus on page load
        And "error-summary" is the active element

        # LPAL-248: error links to invalid field
        When I visit link containing "Choose a type of LPA"
        Then I am focused on "type-property-and-financial"

    # requires additional scenarios as login page doesn't use the error macro;
    # this scenario covers invalid email entered, which uses a different branch
    # of the code from a failed user login
    @RunErrorSummaryCheckAfterStep
    Scenario: Error message heading level and text / server-rendered auth - invalid email (LPAL-247)
        Given I visit "/login"
        And I type "foo" into "login-email"
        And I type "aaa" into "login-password"
        And I click "login-submit-button"
        Then I see "There is a problem" in the page text

        And "error-heading" is a "level 2 heading" element
        And there is "one" "level 1 heading" element on the page

    Scenario: 403 error is returned for potentially sensitive resources (LPAL-1108)
        Given the forbidden filename patterns
            |zip|gz|lzh|tar|rar|7z|swp|bak|git|ht|exe|dll|py|msi|bin|sh|bat|xml|apk|jar|log|sql|conf|cfg|ini|tmp|doc|xls|rtf|
        When I attempt to fetch a resource matching each forbidden filename pattern
        Then I get a 403 response code for each resource

    Scenario: 404 error is returned for PDF download before LPA is complete (LPAL-1105)
        Given I log in as appropriate test user
        And If I am on dashboard I visit the type page
        When I choose Property and Finance
        And I click "save"
        Then I am taken to the donor page

        When I visit the LP1 download page for the test fixture lpa
        Then I see "Page not found (404 error)" in the page text
