    Background:
        Given I ignore application exceptions
        And I create PF LPA test fixture with a donor, attorneys and replacement attorneys

        And I visit the certificate provider page for the test fixture lpa
        # ** CUT Above Here ** This comment line needed for stitching feature files. Please do not remove

        When I click "add-certificate-provider"
        And I opt not to re-use details if lpa is a clone
        Then I can find "form-certificate-provider"
        And I can find "form-cancel"
        And I can find "name-title" with 8 options
        # todo - casper just looked for use-my-details. We need ultimately to actually test this
        And I can find use-my-details if lpa is new
